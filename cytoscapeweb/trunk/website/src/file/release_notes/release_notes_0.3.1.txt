<p>
    This release contains only a few changes:
    <ul>
        <li>Added a default Passthrough Mapper for edge labels, making it easier to display them 
            (you just need to have an edge attribute called <code>"label"</code> in the network data and 
            set <code>edgeLabelsVisible</code> to <code>true</code>).</li>
        <li>The minimum zoom value was decreased from 10% to 1%.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
