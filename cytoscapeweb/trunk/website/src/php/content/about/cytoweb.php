<h1>Background</h1>

<p>Cytoscape Web is actively developed at the
<a href="http://utoronto.ca" rel="external">University of Toronto</a>, in
the <a href="http://tdccbr.med.utoronto.ca" rel="external">Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research</a>,
in the labs of <a href="http://baderlab.org" rel="external">Gary Bader</a> and
<a href="http://morrislab.med.utoronto.ca" rel="external">Quaid Morris</a>.  Cytoscape Web development is funded
by <a href="http://genomecanada.ca" rel="external">Genome Canada</a>, through the
<a href="http://ontariogenomics.ca/" rel="external">Ontario Genomics Institute</a> (2007-OGI-TD-05).</p>

<p>Cytoscape Web was created as a result of the need for a visualisation interface for the
<a href="http://genemania.org" rel="external">GeneMANIA</a> project at the University of Toronto.</p>

<p>The idea was to create a simple version of <a href="http://www.cytoscape.org">Cytoscape</a> for the Web,
not as a final user application, but as an independent component that could be reused by other developers.
Despite using different technologies (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/" rel="external"">Flex</a> and JavaScript), 
Cytoscape Web follows most of the Cytoscape concepts (e.g. node shapes, visual mappings, XGMML support), but to a limited extent.</p>

<p>Cytoscape Web is <strong>open-source</strong> software released under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html" rel="external">LGPL 2.1</a> license.</p>


<h1>Client applications</h1>

<p>Cytoscape Web is currently being used by a gene function prediction server,
<a href="http://genemania.org" rel="external">GeneMANIA</a>.
The data provided to Cytoscape Web in GeneMANIA is unique to every user query, and easily
modified with each new query.  The rendering speed of Cytoscape Web allows for dynamic user
interaction.</p>

<!-- Do not ask about this yet!  Why are you viewing the source? :)
<p>The database of molecular interaction databases, <a href="http://pathguide.org" rel="external">PathGuide</a>,
also uses Cytoscape Web to display a network illustrating the interactions among different molecular
interaction and pathway databases.  The data provided to this network is static, and can only
currently be modified by Pathguide developers.
