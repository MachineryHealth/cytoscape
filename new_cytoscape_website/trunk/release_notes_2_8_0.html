<h1>New Features in Cytoscape 2.8.0</h1>
</p>


<p>
<h3>Custom Graphics</h3>
<p>
We've added the ability to associate images and other custom graphics with nodes. Images
can be loaded manually with our image browser or specified as URLs in attributes.  Programmers
may also use the CyCustomGraphics interface to create images dynamically within plugins.

To connect these images to nodes, the VizMapper provides visual properties that allow up to nine 
images to be mapped independently onto nodes. Users can control both the size and placement of
the image with respect to the node.
</p>

<h3>Equations</h3>
<p>
We've had many requests over the years to provide spreadsheet like functionality in the
attribute browser, and now we have!  Cells in the attribute browser now accept a subset
of Excel-like functions which dynamically compute values as attributes.  We've provided
an equation editor to help users understand the functions that are available as well as
how to properly specify the arguments to a command.  Equations are not meant for heavy
data analysis, but rather as a simple way to manipulate attribute values within Cytoscape.
</p>

<h3>Network Analyzer</h3>
<p>
Mario Albrecht and his team at the Max-Planck Institute for Informatics have graciously
provided their Network Analyzer plugin to Cytoscape as a core plugin.  This means that
Cytoscape now has a full suite of network analysis and graphing routines available right
out of the box!
</p>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<p>
We've fixed many bugs in the latest version of Cytoscape. We hope the changes will
make the Cytoscape user experience more pleasant and consisten.
