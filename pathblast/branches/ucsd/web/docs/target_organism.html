<h2>Target Organism Networks</h2>
The target organisms currently available are listed in the drop down menu on the main page.
The networks available are from the <a href="http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/">DIP</a> database. 
The organisms presented were chosen because they represent large networks that are likely to
return a resulting path.  The DIP database includes many small networks that have not been
included. If an organism that you'd like to search against is missing, 
let us <a href="mailto:msmoot@ucsd.edu">know</a>.
