BLAST E-value Threshold

<h2>BLAST E-Value Threshold</h2>
<p>The BLAST E-value measures the statistical significance threshold for 
reporting protein sequence matches against the yeast genome database; 
the default threshold value is 1E-5, in which 1E-5 matches would be 
expected to occur by chance, according to the stochastic model of Karlin and 
Altschul (Schäffer, A.A. et al. (1999) Bioinformatics 15:1000-1011). </p>

<p>Protein sequences whose BLAST  E-values are less than the E-value Threshold will
be allowed to align against one another in the pathway alignment. Conversely, protein
sequences whose E-values are greater that the E-value threshold will be 
excluded from the pathway alignment. Lower E-value Thresholds are more
stringent, leading to fewer matches being reported. Increasing the threshold shows less stringent matches. </p> 
<p>
The e-value must be presented in either scientific notation (e.g. '1e-05', '1-E5') or in decimal (e.g. 0.0001). Fraction representations (e.g. '1/2') are NOT allowed.
