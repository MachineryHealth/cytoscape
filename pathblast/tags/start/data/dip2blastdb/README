This is a collection of scripts and programs that parses a DIP XIN xml
file along with a DIP fasta file and produces organism specific fasta files
for each organism found in the XIN file. The organism specific fasta files
are then converted into BLAST databases.

Dependencies:
-------------

To run this program, you'll need:

- An XIN formatted DIP database. (http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/)
- A FASTA formatted DIP sequence database. (http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/)
- The formatdb program (part of the BLAST distribution) in your PATH. 
  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/)
- A biojava jar file.  This should be included in the libraries contained
  in this distribution. (http://biojava.org/)


Running:
--------

To run simply call the script dip2blastdb using the XIN xml file as the
first argument, the FASTA file as the second, and an output directory
as the third:

	% dip2blastdb dip.xin dip.fasta output_dir

NOTE: dip2blastdb must be executed from the current directory because of
the location of the java files.
