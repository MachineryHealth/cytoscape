<h2>Duplicate Node Networks</h2>
<p/>
<p>
In many cases a single protein in either the query network will be homologous
with multiple proteins in the target network (or vice versa), which means that multiple compatibility
nodes may be created which share a common protein.  In some cases these compatibility
nodes with a common protein can combine to form a result path. This results in situations 
such as figure 1 where the result path only includes one protein from the query network, or
figure 2 where only two proteins from the query network are included. We call these
duplicate node networks.</p>

In general these results are not what is desired and therefore inclusion of Duplicate Node Networks
is not allowed by default.  However in some cases the resulting networks can be instructive so
we therefore provide an option for including Duplicate Node Networks in the results.
