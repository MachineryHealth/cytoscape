<h2>Duplicate Protein Networks</h2>
<p/>
<p>
In many cases a single protein in the query network will be homologous
with multiple proteins in the target network (or vice versa).
This leads to a situation where a single protein can appear more than
once in the resulting network.

Figure 1 shows a result path that only includes one protein from the query network.  Figure 2 shows and example where only two proteins from the query network are included. We call these
duplicate protein networks.</p>

<p>
While these are valid networks according to the underlying network alignment
algorithms, these results are generally not what is desired. Therefore inclusion of Duplicate Protein Networks
is not allowed by default.  However in some cases the resulting networks can be instructive so we provide an option for including Duplicate Protein Networks in the results.
