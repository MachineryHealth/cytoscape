<h2>BLAST Database Selection</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/tutorial/Altschul-1.html">E-values</a> 
are currently used to determine whether proteins in the query and target
networks are related for purposes of aligning the networks.  The e-values are generated using 
the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/">BLAST program</a> with an all vs. all 
search of the proteins in the query network against the proteins in the species network.
E-values are dependent on the size of the database used to perform the search. The e-value of
an alignment of the same proteins generated using different databases (i.e. NR vs. only Human) will  
produce different e-values despite producing the same alignment and alignment score. 
In the context of PathBLAST, when the same query network
is aligned with two different species networks, the e-values generated will have slightly
different scales because of the different sizes of the species databases.  While this
should have minimal impact on the end result, in the interest of being precise as possible,
we provide the option to generate e-values by searching against the entire DIP sequence
database instead of the specie specific database.  This option allows users searching the
same query network against multiple species to generate e-values for the different
searches that are based on the same database search.
