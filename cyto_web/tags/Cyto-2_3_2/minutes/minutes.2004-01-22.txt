Present: Ethan, Trey, Chris, Andrew, Rowan, Larissa.


1) Release 2.0

Things still to do :
- GML Writer,
- Filters,
 -Hierarchical Layout.
- Documentation, User Manuals
- May be Expression plugin.

Our time estimate is 3 weeks. 2 weeks to finish the code and one week 
for testing.
Ethan  and Gary are doing the testing already on alpha release.

What format should we use for User Manual.
The easiest thing would be to update the old manual word document. Ethan 
volunteered to do that.
We should also have some HTML doc pages and update FAQ page.

Filters will be delivered in a plugin. Rowan will move them to /common.

Regarding directed/undirected edges discussion, Rowan will send Rob his 
thoughts on that in e-mail.

2) Non-visual mode for Cytoscape.

Non visual mode for Cytoscape is at the top of the list of the new features.
 Should we include it in 2.0?
The user would like to perform alogrithms on a big network without 
vizualizing the whole network and then bring visualization on for 
selected region of the graph.
We should be able to turn visualization of the graff on and off through 
the eye ball icon on a tool bar. Clicking on that icon would
cause stop listening to the graph and resume listening... Also should be 
passed as a comand line argument.
With Iliana's new GraphController it seems to be quite easy to implement.
