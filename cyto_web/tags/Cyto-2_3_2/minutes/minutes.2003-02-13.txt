(1) Visualization mapper- committing it into the Core

* Andrew has finished loading calculators from vizmap.props file

* We would also like to be able to save UI-configured
  mappings back to vizmap.props.  Owen asks if this could
  be backwards compatible with the old cytoscape.props
  file format?  Could be a fair bit of work, Andrew
  concludes, but he offers to take a try.

* When should we prompt the user to save the mappings?
    - on CytoscapeWindow close
    - from a save button in the vizmapper
  Paul suggests that cytoscape.props and vizmap.props
  can be given any arbitrary name if it is specified
  in a project file with the -p command line option.

* At Owen's request, we agree to move vizmapper to the Core.

* Gary asks about how easy vizmapper is to use, and if
  we can make it more accessible to casual users.
  Owen/Jonathan are currently working on a toolbar giving access
  to node and edge property "defaults" and are also making
  available common visual mapping schemes as predefined,
  selectable items.

(2) Paul gets feedback about the tutorial website

* Paul has now produced a relatively mature first
  tutorial using WebStart.

* At Paul's proposal, we agree that the next release of
  Cytoscape be primarily based on Java WebStart.

* Owen asks how we can track downloads with Java WebStart.
  We agree to let this go, if we can track the IP
  address of the downloader, and perhaps get them to
  agree to a LGPL license at download time.

* The best was to promote Cytoscape are through:
  - Publishing the Cytoscape paper
  - Referencing Cytoscape in other papers
  - Mentioning Cytoscape in talks and posters
  - Linking to websites such as BIND

(3) Cytoscape.org website

* The Whitehead has a team of programmers that are revamping
  people's websites. We agree to let them have a go at
  redesigning Cytoscape's website over the next few weeks.

* What about documentation?  Paul's tutorial will handle
  a lot of this.  In addition, we have the Cytoscape
  paper, and Trey will convert the old manual into a pdf
  form.

* We will upload and link the existing JavaDoc to the
  cytoscape.org website.  This will be nasty and incomplete,
  but will provide people with some documentation now,
  while motivating us to fix the glaring holes.

(4) Gary talks about SeqHound

* Paul waits for BIND'a API update, Java, etc.
  Or at least an update on the progress of said API.
