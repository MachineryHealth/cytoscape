1. Paul have been working on the Cross Reference tool usingJava Expert
System Shell (JESS)
that has a handy approach to transfer UNIGEN to Locus Link and UNIGEN
toKEGG. This is not a general tool but suits well to
avoid writing long custom scripts. Paul will write a paragraph or two on
this matter and send it to us.
The project seems not to interfere with the the work Gary and Eathan are
doing on data services.

2. The new jar loader mechanism available to the core now and classes
are resigning in jarloader directory.
You can now pass a jar file to load a plugin. (Very nice!). There is no
default directory for the plugin manager to look now.
The  CYTOSCAPE_HOME/jars  directory and current directory were proposed
for this default.
This jar loader mechanism relies now on the obfuscation table of the
Retroguard for the y.files, so that makes it useless for people who
don't have y.files and the obfuscation table.
But usefull for us and for other developers, to whom we can send this
y.files table. (Like David Goode). When we replace y.files it will have
more general use.

3. Paul is working on KEGG Pathway and HTTP loader. KEGG SBML files  the
Cytoscape project file get generated that is stored on the Cytoscape site.
The plugin reads those files from the site, stores them to temp files
and then loads those to Cytoscape. Paul will put a new Demo for the KEGG
plugin within next week.

4. Rowen and Iliana doing a search for a nice open source praph package.
Right now  the best choice seems to be Graph from Piccolo API.
They are also looking in to the JGraph and others.

5. Iliana works on a plugin that creates a different graph in "collapse
view". We would like to ask Iliana to provide a brief summary on this
approach and may be have a
e-mail discussion on that.  That brought the need for the web based
content management system again.  We are still looking in to the Maven
and Wiki.

6. Rick Yang was here at Seattle for the ISB Symposium. Cytoscape was
mentioned several times there in a good way...

7. Loading native libraries from the jars is a doable task. You need to
call System.loadLibrary(jar) for that.

8. The paper is coming out in the  Nature Biotech. This is not
particular Cytoscape paper. Owen will sent a link for that paper.
9.  Paul is envolved in the research and passing the core rewriting to
Andrew and will assist him 50% of the time.

10. Ethan and Gary are planning to add database functionality to their
Data Services on example of ASPRE? that already has it database
functionality with the GRIDD database, cashing generic contents localy.
Two weeks iteration...
The project arquitecture doc will be posted on the TechDoc site for
comments and reviews.

11. To get rid of the scary warning message when Cytoscape gets
downloaded  or run by WebStart we can sign our code with the VerySign
that provides the authentication of the Java code distribution. That
will envolve few extra steps for the person who is doing distribution
build, but can be automated.

12. Next build may be done next week.
We will let conditional plugin loading go for now...
