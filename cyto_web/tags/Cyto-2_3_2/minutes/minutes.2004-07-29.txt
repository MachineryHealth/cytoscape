Cytoscape Meeting Minutes
Date:  July 29, 2004

Present:  Trey, Rowan, Rob, Chris, Ethan

I.  New Programmer

Trey has a new Cytoscape programmer starting today.  His name is Nerius,
and he will be attending the Cytoscape retreat.

Nerius will probably start with a few new pages on the cytoscape.org web
site.  He will then start working on a general  "Pathway Editor"  This
would enable users to add Node / Edge attributes directly without having
to load up specific files.  Trey suggested that we might simply start out
by cloning or reproducing the functionality of the YFiles YEd interface.

At some point, Trey would also like to resurrect the Undo manager.

Chris wondered if we are currently happy with the current data structure
we use for storing attributes.

Rowan:  we are not really that happy.  We should probably refactor
graphObject attributes.

II. Large Networks

A user wrote to Ethan, who subsequently wrote to the Google group re:
very large networks.  Rowan says the large BIND files works fine on Linux,
but Ethan can't get any of the them to render in Mac OS X.
Rowan will look into the issue further.
