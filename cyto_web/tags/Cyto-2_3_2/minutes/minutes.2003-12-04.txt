Cytoscape Meeting Minutes
December 4th 2003
Scribe: Trey Ideker
In attendance: Benno, Gary, Trey, Chris W., Ryan, Andrew, Ethan, Iliana
=================================================================

1) GINY and Cytoscape refactoring Giny API has a root graph which can
have multiple graph perspectives.  Graph perspectives can have a
GraphView.  Iliana is currently writing code to synchronize the graph
perspective with the graph view. Relevant classes are
GraphViewController, GraphViewHandler, etc.  In editing these classes,
she has identified several GINY bugs which she and Rowan have fixed.
In general, many GINY bugs are getting fixed and people should update
their CVS dirs.  

Rowan is profiling GINY code on linux using jProfiler, which the ISB
now owns.  People mention that it also important to profile on Mac.

Ethan mentions that he now has a java class that converts a yFiles
graph to a GINY graph perspective.  It currently just respects network
nodes and edges.  He will check it into the CVS common plugins
directory.

Rowan found some layout algorithms that he will copy, and will also
get to work on porting Anton Enright's BioLayout code.  

Ryan had a question about plugin development with GINY.  Should
plugins interface to CytoscapeWindow or to CyWindow?  The answer is
CyWindow, at least for the "new" Cytoscape 2.0 version we are working
on.  Also, please reference the API that has been sent to the cytostaff
list.

Gary asks whether yFiles support will be dropped altogether in
Cytoscape 2.0.  The answer is yes.

GML reader is checked in (Chris).  The remaining problem: how to encode
graph layout and other node and edge attributes in the GML?

The major items to complete are:
   Layout algorithms (Rowan)
   GML reader/writer (Chris W.)
   Migrate filters package (Rowan)
   Undo manager will come later (Iliana)

=================================================================
2) Update on Cytoscape grant

We received a priority score of 191 on a scale from 100 (best) to 500 
(worst).
=================================================================
3) Future meeting times

We agree that 2pm (PST) Thursdays will be the new meeting time.
=================================================================
4) Current list of bugs

a. Feature request--> Cannot control text color
b. Cannot find/load jar file on Windows

=================================================================
5) BETA release of 2.0

Internal release (development prerelease) will be December, end of
next week (Friday December 12th).  It will be available at
http://www.cytoscape.org/beta.html

=================================================================
6) Copyright statement

Whitehead needs to be changed to UCSD.  Sloan-Kettering needs to be
added.  These changes will be made to the new 2.0 BETA source code
files.  Gary says that we should keep a copy of this up-to-date
license in the Cytoscape directory structure so that everyone can get
access to it.  Andrew agrees to do this.
