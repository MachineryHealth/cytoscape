Meeting Minutes for 8/14/2003:
-----------------------------
In attendance:  Trey, Paul, Andrew, Rowan, Larissa, Chris, Jonathan, Phil,
Ryan.
(let me know if I missed anyone here. I'm still putting voices to names.)

I. Active Modules:
  Much of this functionality has been ported to java by Ryan Kelley.
  A jar file will soon be placed on the plugins page for testing by the
  development team.

II. Java Compilers:
  With regard to active modules and time performance in Java, the
  suggestion was made to test IBM's java compiler. Two versions
  available, "jikes"(?) version resulting in faster code. Would require
  IBM's RTE?

III. Cytoscape Meeting in Seattle:
  Meeting is in two weeks (8/29,30), Rowan agreed to help Benno with
  organization.

IV. Bugs List:
  Needs more categories.
  Vizmapper bug relating to image location has been documented by
  Jonathan.

V. New Data Structures:
  General discussion of Paul's mail from 8/10. All agreed that a
  datacube class should evolve to replace the current expression data
  class. One data cube for both node and edge data or one for node data
  and one for edge data? Will be discussed further in the meeting.

VI. Meeting Minutes:
  Minutes should be put online. Probably not for the world to see but
  would be helpful for the development team. Owen was performing this
  task. Who will start this up again?

VII. Refactoring: (by Andrew)
  Vizmapper has been refactored. Few more weeks needed for core
  refactoring. Plugins will be the next target for this effort.

VIII. Graph Library:
  Will be demonstrated (by Rowan?) at the meeting.

IX. SBML Reader:
  Paul would like a reviewer for his new class (Ethan or Gary?).
