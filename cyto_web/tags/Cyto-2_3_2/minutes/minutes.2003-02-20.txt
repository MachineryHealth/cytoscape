*** Loading Jars.

Owen and Jonathan have a way to load jars.
Coming soon to a plugin near you.  This doesn't
resolve the obfuscation problem, however.

We speak at some length about obfuscation.


*** Rewrite core.

Benno and Paul talked about whether this is something
that is wanted.  They agreed that it is wanted.

half-time req for documenting the core is opening
at ISB on March 1.

Paul suggests some plugins should be sanctioned and reviewed,
as a way of deciding which Cytoscape fctns need to be stable.

Benno suggests levels of stability; Paul mentions the use of
the "deprecated" keyword.


*** next release.

"v0.99"
Ideally released in February, as the month draws to a close.

plugins to include
 activemodules
 expressiondata

we'll talk more next week.


*** vizmapper.

 - we should remove the ToolTip tabs for now.
 - we should make sure it's relatively free of bugs
 - reading from old-style works
 - 2 things remain:
     writing back to file (next week)
     cleaning up dregs

benno says saving should be automatic;
analogous to preferences, rather than a file.

*** UndoableGraphHider.
 - terrible bug foung by andrew; being resolved.
