--------------- new release of source from cytoscape.org
There have been many important additions since the last release:

   - vizmzpper with calculators
   - new annotation GUI
   - improved active modules UI
   - pdf manual

Owen & Jonathan have made good progress on loading plugins from a jar,
but we won't include this quite yet.

We will include some compiled plugins with the cytoscape.jar provided with this
release.

We agreed to call this "release 1.0" and to get it up on the website by
next Monday (or so).

The website will also include a prominent javaws link (to java webstart cytoscape
without a network), and a easily found link to the two examples created
so far for the tutorial.

--------------- yfiles obfuscation

Owen, Jonathan, and Roland have been exchaning email to sort out how much or how
little obfuscation yfiles actually needs.  Roland indicated (but has not yet confirmed)
that simply wrapping the yfiles calls may be okay.  Since this contradicts our
reading of the license, we won't act on this unless Roland explicitly confirms it.

--------------- Iliana proposes a 'metagraph' extension to cytoscape

Briefly, this allows any subgraph, at any logical level, to become a node.
This is a substantial project, which may mesh well with the April-May refactoring
of the core Paul plans to do.  Iliana will send out a short, prose-only proposal
soon.

--------------- Andrew on saving visual mappings to a file
Andrew has the flu this week, but predicts that this job can be completed with
a couple of days work once he returns to good health.
Related to this, and tied to the release of version 1.0, Trey suggests that some of the mapping
names can be improved.
