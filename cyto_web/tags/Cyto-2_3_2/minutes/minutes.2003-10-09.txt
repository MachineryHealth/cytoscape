1. GINY-Files Simul-Cyto ( Larissa, Me, Andrew )
cvsdir5 now contains a version of Cytoscape that can use Y-Files ( ant 
run ), or GINY ( ant giny ).

new plugins should use GINY.

Chris is working on a GML r/w.

To get working, get GINY:
http://csbi.sourceforge.net/

either get the release from the download page, or get the CVS version( 
preffered )

gbader added as developer.
ecerami and cerami did not work.

2. Refactor. ( Andrew )
CytoscapeWindow re-org is done.  Andrew now just wants to do some 
clean-up and documentation which should take another week.
Specifically startup needs to be changed.


3. UI ( Gary )
Gary will send around UI problems.  They will then get fixed at some point.

This discussion led to the need for some discussion about where we want 
to go.

4. Obfuscateion
Is still a PITA, may be better by using YGuard.  We don't know if we can 
add things to the classpath after downloading Cytoscape1.1.
