Meeting Minutes

Present: Benno, Andrew, Rowan, Larissa, Ethan, Trey.

1.  Next release and jar files.

Ethan checked in the release changes to the cvs dir4 and cvs dir5. Right 
now  in cvs dir5  lib directory we have a list of jar files that you 
need to run cytoscape. Do we create a one big cytoscape.jar file and 
bundle all the libraries there or do we keep the separate jars in the 
lib? There are advantages and disadvantages in both cases. We desided 
that 1)Rowan will check in all giny jar files to the cvs,
2)Ethan will change build.xml to create one  huge cytoscape.jar when you 
are doing release/ distribution.

2. Rowan asked the question how we are loading plugins with the 
Cytoscape running from WebStart? Good question, Andrew will look in to 
that, there must be the way to specify plugins directory in WebStart...
Eventually we would like to have a smart plugin loader that perhaps 
looks on the web-site and gives you a list of available plugins, etc.

Ethan checked out cvsdir5 and will play(test) it farther. So far he 
likes it...

It would be nice to convert DataServices plugins to use giny.

Trey joins the meeting.
- Cytoscape paper is out next week on the Genome Research.
- With in next two weeks we will hear the score of the Cytoscape grant. 
We are hoping to get a good score!

-Chris is working on GML writer-reader.

3) Giny-refactoring update.
We discussed the progress after the meeing at ISB and Benno will send 
everybody a summary of the Giny/Refactoring  development updates with 
the time estimates. ( Sneak preview: We will try to have beta release of 
giny version for the group review and testing next Thursday :-) )
