Cytoscape Meeting Minutes, December 18, 2003
---------------------------------------------
Present:  Gary, Rob, Ethan, Trey, Chris, Benno, Rowan, Larissa, Iliana,
Phil.

1.  Refactoring update

Rowan has fixed 2 significant bugs:  a) edge direction now fixed b)
disappearing edges now fixed.  Both are wow ready for an Alpha Release 2.
Ethan will do Alpha 2 release on Friday.

Andrew is working on removing Y-Files.  Will be done by end of next week.

2.  Collaborations

Trey has been talking to several different groups about Cytoscape
collaborations.  Here is a summary:

Bruce Conklin (GenMAPP)
Ron Shamir (PIVOT: Protein Interactions VisualizatiOn Tool)
Ken Buetow (NCI Ca BIO database)
Teri Klein and Russ Altman (PharmGKB)
Mike Waters (NIEHS CEBS database)

Ken Buetow is particularly interested in integrating caBIO/caCORE with
Cytoscape.  For example, NCI now provides access to BioCarta Pathway
diagrams in SVG format.  Ken is interested in adding a link for these
diagrams, such as "View this pathway in Cytoscape." Rowan mentioned that
it will take a lot of work to expand Cytoscape into a full pathway
browser.

Benno also talked to a group at BioMedNet, and Gary mentioned
BioMedCentral.  Gary suggested that ISMB would be a good venue for meeting
with new collaborators.

3.  Bug Parade

We went through most of the new bugs (mostly logged by Ethan).  Main point
of discussion concerned which layout algorithms must be in Cytoscape 2.0.
These are:  Hierarchical, Circular, and Spring Embedded Layout.

4.  Grant

We got initial reviews on the Cytoscape grant.  Cytoscape was reviewed in
the middle of the pack.  This might have been good enough last year, but
with funding cuts, nothing is certain.  Benno, Gary and Trey met
separately after the conference call to dicsuss specific grant issues.
