    Andrew is working on it
- javadoc for new API
   will enable 'ant doc' rule

- should wait for Illiana's return? (biomodules)
    (should the release of the core depend on plugins?)
- make sure old active modules code is removed
- manual needs to be purged of all references to active modules
    done by Trey, emailed .doc to Ethan
- /user_docs/MANUAL.txt to be removed (?)
