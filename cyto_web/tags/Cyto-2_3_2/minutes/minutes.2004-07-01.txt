Almost all bugs that are high priority are taken care of. Seems
         to be that no crash bugs are left.

bug 270 - workaround found by rowan - dependant on what you choose to
         click on. If you click away on another name or tab and
         back, it then works

issue: saving multiple attributes in one file. Should show all the
         attributes that you are saving at the bottom. This functionality
         will be put in the core now .. and debugged before release.

Release date: This will be the official 2.0 release. We should be
         thinking about where to post announcements. Maybe wait a week:
         next Thursday we will release and coordinate this with the
         website update. We will keep the user form. Keep the 1.1.1
         version available as old.

Paul Spellman writing a grant. Supporting cluster and tree-view --
         suggested linking this to cytoscape. (Cluster gene expression
         data in his software, click on cluster, then launch cytoscpae
         to visualize that cluster)

Another collaboration: Andre Califano?

layout: anyone working on them?

Student --- looking for jobs -- maybe layout would be a type of job
         that didn't require deep knowledge of cytoscape architecture.
         (bio layout?) Spring embedded layout not based on edges but
         on any shared numeric attributes. Also maybe principal
         component based layout or self organizing maps layout?
