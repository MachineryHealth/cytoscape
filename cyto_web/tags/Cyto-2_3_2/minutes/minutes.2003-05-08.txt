Cytoscape Team Meeting Notes
Date: May 8, 2003

Today was a relatively short meeting.  Two major topics were covered:

(1) Progress on data services - Ethan

Has created a plugin that replicates how Osprey talks to the GRID
database.  In Osprey, the user typically selects a protein in the
network and gets data associated with that protein.  In general, three
different data items are retrieved:

a) NCBI to get the genbank flatfile- parsed with BioJava
b) Grid to get the GO terms associated with that particular protein
c) Grid to get a list of proteins that interact with that particular protein

A button press adds these interactions to the current working graph.
Ethan has implemented this core functionality and will send us a
tarfile on Monday for examination.  Mike Tyers et al. have given us
permission to talk directly to GRID using direct SQL calls via JDBC.

(2) Progress on plugin loader and next Cytoscape release - Owen

The last piece of plugin-loading functionality was added to the Core
this week.  Owen wonders if we can therefore do a build and update
Cytoscape on the website.  However, Larissa points out that there is
no documentation for the plugin loader yet.  Owen points out there are
two manuals that should be written: information for users and for
developers.  Ethan offers to help Owen with this offline.  They should
have this documentation online next week.

Once the jar loader is made available on the website, then any user
will be able to write plugins separately from the Cytoscape core,
provided that they have the correct "obfuscation table".  This will be
distributed only within the Cytoscape core development team.

*** IMPORTANT-- LOOK HERE *** The current obfuscation table is checked
into CVS under cytoscape/tools/jars.  Ethan says that when he releases
his data services plugin (see 1 above) he will use the obfuscation
table to obfuscate the plugin.

(3) Proposal / concrete plan for replacing yFiles with an open-source
graph package, as well as a refactoring of the core.

This is currently being investigated by the ISB team with aid from
Rowan.  They are aiming to have a proposal on the table by this next
week, at the next meeting.
