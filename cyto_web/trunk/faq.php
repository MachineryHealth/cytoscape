    <td><strong>A</strong>: </td>
    <td>The message “all plugins have been successfully loaded” means all of the plugins found in the plugins dir are actually loaded.  The "plugins" menu is somewhat misleading as there is no requirement that a plugin actually present itself there.  For example, the biopax plugin is accessed simply by importing a biopax formatted file.  Other plugins are found throughout the application, like the cPath plugin that is accessed through the "File -> New -> Network -> Construct network using cPath" menu.</td>
