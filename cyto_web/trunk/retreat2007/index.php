   <h2>Cytoscape Symposium and Developers Retreat</h2>
   <h3>November 6-9, 2007</h3>
   <h3>Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands</h3>
  </div>

The Cytoscape community organizes a retreat each year to establish a
roadmap for Cytoscape development. Until now these were held in the
USA. At last year&rsquo;s retreat the possibility of organizing the
next retreat in Europe was raised and the Cytoscape team was
enthusiastic. The Human Genetics Department of the AMC has accepted the
challenge of organizing this year's meeting<br>

Amsterdam is a great location for such an event; the vibrant historic city 
offers plenty opportunities for social activities.<br>  

The goal of the retreat is threefold:

<ol>

  <li>Establish a development roadmap for the next year </li>

  <li>Involve the large user community in Europe in Cytoscape
development</li>

  <li>Gather user feedback and use it to plan future development.
  </li>

</ol>

We want to reach these goals in a retreat spanning four days. The first
and last day (6 and 9 November)are mainly intended for the Cytoscape core development
team and other developers who write their own Cytoscape plugins. The
second and third days are aimed at a wide audience of molecular
biologists and bioinformaticians in the Netherlands, Europe and
internationally. To attract them a formidable list of confirmed speakers 
will present their scientific work at the public symposium on November 8<sup>th</sup> 
entitled <a href="programme.php#nov_8">Integrative Bioinformatics: At the cutting edge of network analysis and biological data integration</a>.
