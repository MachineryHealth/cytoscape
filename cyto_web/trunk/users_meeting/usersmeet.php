		The Cytoscape team would like to invite you to the 1st Cytoscape Users Meeting,<BR>
		held at the Institute For Systems Biology (<A HREF="http://www.systemsbiology.org">ISB</A>) in Seattle on April 25th 2006<BR>
	        (after the <A HREF= "http://systemsbiology.org/symposium/">Systems Biology and Medicine Symposium</A>
		also held at the ISB on April <BR>23rd-24th).<BR><BR>
		You will have the opportunity of meeting Cytoscape developers who will be eager<BR>
		to hear your thoughts, ideas, experiences, and needs concerning the Cytoscape<BR>
		application from a  user's perspective. This meeting will not be a developer<BR>
		oriented meeting. Its purpose is to reach out to biologists, wet-lab scientists,<BR>
		and other Cytoscape end-users.
		<BR><BR>				
		Registration for this event is now closed.
		<BR><BR>
		Participants are responsible for making their own travel arrangements.<BR></B>
