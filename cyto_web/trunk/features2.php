	<h2>What is Cytoscape?</h2>
	<img src="images/intro_2.png" />
	<img src="images/intro_1.png" />
	<p>
		<strong><i>Cytoscape</i></strong> is an open source bioinformatics software platform for <strong><i>
		visualizing</i></strong> molecular interaction networks and biological pathways and 
		<strong><i>integrating</i></strong> these networks with annotations, gene expression 
		profiles and other state data. &nbsp; Although Cytoscape was originally designed for 
		biological research, now it is a general platform for complex network analysis and 
		visualization. &nbsp;  Cytoscape <i>core</i> distribution provides a basic set of features 
		for data integration and visualization. &nbsp; Additional features are available as 
		<strong><i>plugins</i></strong>. &nbsp; Plugins are available for network and molecular 
		profiling analyses, new layouts, additional file format support, scripting, and connection 
		with databases. &nbsp; Plugins may be developed by anyone using the Cytoscape open API based on 
		<a href="http://www.java.com/en/" target="_blank">Java&#8482;</a> technology and plugin 
		<a href="community.php"> community development</a> is encouraged.  Most of the 
		plugins are <a href="plugins/index.php">freely available</a>.

<div class="introduction1">
	<h2>Features</h2>
</div>

<div class="introduction">
<h3>Data Integration</h3>
<div id="block">		
	<div id="block1">
	<h4>Supports Many Standards</h4>
	<img src="images/intro_3.png" />
	<p>
		Cytoscape supports a lot of standard network and annotation file formats including: SIF 
		(Simple Interaction Format), <a href="http://www.infosun.fim.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/GML/">
		GML</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~puninj/XGMML/">XGMML</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.biopax.org/">BioPAX</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.psidev.info/index.php?q=node/60">PSI-MI</a>, 
		<a href="http://sbml.org/Main_Page">SBML</a>, <a href="http://www.obofoundry.org/">OBO</a>, 
		and <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/GO.format.annotation.shtml">Gene Association</a>.  
		Delimited text files and MS Excel&#8482; Workbook are also supported and you can import 
		data files, such as expression profiles or <a href="http://www.geneontology.org">GO</a> 
		annotations, generated by other applications 
		or spreadsheet programs.  Using this feature, you can load and save arbitrary attributes 
		on nodes, edges, and networks.  For example, input a set of custom annotation terms for 
		your proteins, create a set of confidence values for your protein-protein interactions.
	</p>
	
	
	
	<h4>Web Service Clients</h4>
	<img src="images/intro_4.png" />
	<p>
		Cytoscape works as a web service client.  This means Cytoscape can directly connect to 
		the external public databases and imports network and annotation data.  Currently, 
		<a href="http://www.pathwaycommons.org/pc/">Pathway Commons</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/site/index.jsf">IntAct</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.biomart.org/">BioMart<a/>, 
		<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene">NCBI Entrez Gene</a>, 
		and <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/picr/">PICR</a> are supported.  And we continue to 
		develop new service clients for popular databases.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="block2">
	<h4>Interoperability</h4>
	<img src="images/intro_5.png" />
	<p>
		Since Cytoscape supports import/export standard file formats, you can easily put Cytoscape 
		into your workflow.  For example, if you have a network data generated by 
		<a href="http://cneurocvs.rmki.kfki.hu/igraph/">igraph</a> or 
		<a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/GraphsAndNetworks.html">Bioconductor</a>, 
		Cytoscape can load the file as a text table and you can export it in PSI-MI format for 
		other bioinformatics tools or your own programs/scripts.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Session File</h4>
	<img src="images/intro_6.png" />
	<p>
		You can save your work by a single click.  All of settings, data files, and visualizations 
		are packed in a session file.  It is called <i>Cytoscape Session (.cys) file</i>.  
		Cytoscape Session file includes networks, attributes (for node/edge/network), Desktop 
		states (selected/hidden nodes and edges, window sizes), Properties, some plugin states, 
		and Visual Styles.

<div class="introduction">
<h3>Visualization</h3>	
<div id="block">	
	<div id="block1">
	<h4>VizMapper&#8482;</h4>
	<img src="images/intro_12.png" />
	<img src="images/intro_7.png" />
	<p>
		Customize network data display using powerful 
		<a href="http://www.cytoscape.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/Cytoscape_User_Manual/Visual_Styles">
		<strong><i>Visual Styles</i></strong></a>.  
		View a superposition of gene expression ratios and p-values on the network. &nbsp;
		Expression data can be mapped to node color, label, border thickness, or border color, 
		etc. according to user-configurable colors and visualization schemes.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Image Export</h4>
	<img src="images/pdficon_large.gif" />
	<p>
		You can export networks as publishiable-quality images.  Supports PDF, EPS, SVG, PNG, 
		JPEG, and BMP files.  Vector images (PDF and EPS) can be modified by other application 
		such as Adobe Illustrator for further enhancements.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="block2">
	<h4>Layout</h4>
	<img src="images/intro_9.png" />
	<p>
		Layout networks in two dimensions. &nbsp;A variety of layout algorithms are available, 
		including cyclic, tree, force-directed, edge-weight, and yFiles Organic layouts.  You can 
		also use Manual Layout tools similar to other graphics application user interface.
	</p>
	<h4>Browsing</h4>
	<img src="images/intro_11.png" />
	<p>
		Zoom in/out and pan for browsing the network.  Use the network manager to easily organize 
		multiple networks.  And this structure can be saved in a session file.  Use the <i>bird's 
		eye view</i> to easily navigate large networks.  Easily navigate large networks (100,000+ nodes and edges) by efficient rendering engine.

<div class="introduction">
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<div id="block">
	<div id="block1">
	<h4>Filter</h4>
	<img src="images/intro_16.png" />
	<p>
		<strong>Filter the network</strong> to select subsets of nodes and/or interactions based 
		on the current data. &nbsp;For instance, users may select nodes involved in a threshold 
		number of interactions, nodes that share a particular GO annotation, or nodes whose gene 
		expression levels change significantly in one or more conditions according to p-values 
		loaded with the gene expression data.  You can create new networks from the filtering result.
	</p>

	<h4>Search</h4>
	<img src="images/intro_8.png" />
	<img src="images/intro_17.png" />
	<p>
		<strong>Search target nodes and edges</strong> by Quick Find or Enhanced Search.  
		<a href="http://conklinwolf.ucsf.edu/genmappwiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2007/Maital">
		Lucene Syntax</a> 
		is supported by <i>Enhanced Search Plugin (ESP)</i> for arbitrary complex queries.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="block2">
	<h4>Find Modules/ Clusters</h4>
	<img src="images/intro_14.png" />
	<img src="images/intro_15.png" />
	<p>
		<strong>Find active subnetworks/pathway modules</strong>. The network is screened against gene expression data to identify connected sets of interactions, i.e. <i>interaction subnetworks</i>, whose genes show particularly high levels of differential expression. &nbsp;The interactions contained in each subnetwork provide hypotheses for the regulatory and signaling interactions in control of the observed expression changes.
		<strong>Find clusters (highly interconnected regions)</strong> in any network loaded into Cytoscape. Depending on the type of network, clusters may mean different things. For instance, clusters in a protein-protein interaction network have been shown to be protein complexes and parts of pathways. Clusters in a protein similarity network represent protein families.
