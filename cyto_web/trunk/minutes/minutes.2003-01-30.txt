Minutes for Cytoscape meeting Thursday, January 30.2003:

Present:
Whitehead: Trey, Owen, Jonathan
ISB: Andrew, Paul
MSKCC: Gary

Minutes: Gary

1. New demos
2. Osprey
3. New vizMapper
4. Plugins as jar files

1. Paul brought up building demos for Yeast
Paul is on the GO friends mailing list, which recently announce SGD
improved annotation for yeast.  One thing to do here would be to have
that as a web start feature, then any yeast biologist could get that
data just by clicking on a link.

Paul would like to grow the number of tutorials as well.  Paul would be
glad to put up tutorials at a rate of 1/week.  This would add user
friendliness to Cytoscape and make things clearer.

We then looked at the Halo demo as an example of this.

(This wasn't working for Gary, but a new version of Java fixed the
problem)

Paul then asked "What is a good yeast demo?"
Trey suggested the classical Gal filtered GML file with expression data
and GO, maybe KEGG markup would be a good start.  Then a few brief
pointers on how to get your own data in to Cytoscape on top of that.

We also need to find a good place from cytoscape.org to put these
tutorials and demos.

Trey wondered when would be a good time to link to the Halo demo?  When
it's ready, it should be linked right away.

2. Osprey
Paul asked Gary to talk about Osprey.

The Tyers lab has limited resources to take Osprey to the next versions
(with all of the features that they want to put in).  Cytoscape already
has a lot of these features, like expression data integration.  Osprey
has a lot of good user interface features because this is what they
concentrate on.  The Tyers lab is open to work together to create the
tool that all biologists need :)

The practicality of working together would have to be addressed, as the
group may be growing too fast, but it should work if we take it slow and
steady. (Added from discussion with Trey and Benno yesterday)

One plan to move forward on this would be to have Osprey as a plugin for
Cytoscape and maybe integrate the Cytoscape graph library into Osprey.
Then Osprey could further be integrated over time.
Paul suggested having the mouse over feature integrated into Cytoscape
as a test.  When the mouse moves over a node, the annotation appears in
a frame window.  Paul could coordinate with the Osprey guys (Bobby-Joe
Breitkreutz and Chris Stark in Toronto).
This feature could be implemented in Cytoscape using a separate window.

Trey suggests prioritizing features according to the Tyers' lab
requirements and some of these features could be worked on by the
Cytoscape team, since Cytoscape would eventually need them in any case.
This would be a way to meet them half way.

Gary mentioned that Bobby-Joe might want to come to Seattle to meet
people there.  This seems to be a good idea.

The details of all of this would have to be worked out on a conference
call.

3. Andrew and Owen then brought up the new visual mapper.  It is
awesome!
Jonathan, Owen and Andrew have put in a huge amount of work. Andrew
mentioned that core part is functional and would likely be done in a
couple of days.

Owen mentioned that the UI has come a long way.  Features are all there,
but not guaranteed bug free yet.  You can do continuous and discrete
mappings, colors, other features of arrows, arrowheads and nodes, etc.

Andrew wanted Owen to please send out instructions on using this as a
plugin again.  This has now been done.

One problem is that colour schemes are not persistent.  Jonathan may
have fixed this already.

A redraw issue would be solved by putting it into the core. Owen is
super eager to put this into the core.  Paul is hesitant, but may have a
solution.  It may be able to replace the old vizmapper with a single
method call.  Eventually we would like to see this in the core.

Action item:  Gary and other's check out the vizmapper and approve
integration into the core.

Trey asks if font size and font style can be done soon.  Might be
possible to change the font as well.  Paul will check into this.

Owen mentioned that one problem with vizMapper is that there are 14
tabs, one for each visual attribute.  This is too many!  What about
pull-down menus.  Any suggestions are welcome to making this look nicer.

4. Trey brought up that he would very much like to have plugins as
separate JARs from the core.  This would enable people to more easily
trade plugins. A website or web service could be eventually built that
Cytoscape could poll for plugins.

But, obfuscation may be a major problem for this feature.  One solution
may be to pass the graph itself between plugins.  Once the plugin has
the graph, it could use its own graph library to deal with it.

Trey felt that there definitely needs more time spent investigating this
before moving forward on the feature.
