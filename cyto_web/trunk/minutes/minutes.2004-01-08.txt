1. Cytoscape 2.0 feature freeze
    Cytoscape 2.0 will be released when the following criteria are met:
       1. Hierarchical Layout
       2. GML I/O
       3. Filter Completion
       4. Thorough testing/profiling optimization.
      
    Ethan will be releasing periodic releases to 
cytoscape.org/alpha.html, everyone is encouraged to try these out and 
log all bugs. 

2. cyto-aux, deprecated
    The old "cyto-aux.jar" will be replaced by the actual pacakges that 
went into it, this way future updates will be easier since we will have 
a better idea of which versions we are using.  A new ant target will be 
created for automatically launching Cytoscape with plugins and graphs 
and data loaded.  The manifest/cytoscape.manifest file will be updated 
so that "java -jar lib/cytoscape.jar" will launch Cytoscape without 
having to specify a classpath on the command line.

3. Bugs
    Some bugs involving not being able to reach the download page.  This 
was atributed to the server.

4. MetaNode plugin
    Iliana is working on a metanode plugin for general use that will 
allow people to make and manipulate metanodes.  It is extendable and 
will be used in her future re-implementation of Biomodules.

5. Headless Mode
    Iliana's "GraphViewController" class will be modified so that when 
"resumeControlling" is called, the GraphView will figure out all of the 
changes on the Perspective since it stopled listening.  During this 
time, Cytoscape will essentially be in the often discussed 
"headless-mode".  Iliana will let us know when this is done.
