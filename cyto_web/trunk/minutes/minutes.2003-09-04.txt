Details:
 
Refactor Status (Andrew)
Replaced Cy.Window with Cy.Network, Cy.Window, and Cytoscape; now working on getting the rest of the core working with new code.  
Estimate of 5 weeks work for core, no estimate for plugins.  
API is an open issue; old API will be left for old Cytoscape.Window. 
Documentation is coming.
New classes are stable for use by plugin writers.
CVS dir5 is stable, needs to be noted in javadocs.
 
Cover Art (Trey/Paul)
Generated by Rich Bonneau at ISB for Paul to pass off to Trey and Benno.  
 
Giny/GIY (Rowan)
Work is continuing.  Giny will emulate YFiles API and extend
so that YFiles will still be able to plugin.  Remaining work 
includes adding methods for nodes and methods. Andrew 
proposed compiling a list of plugins, and asking individuals 
to claim them by next week.
 
GML Writer/Reader (Rowan)
Cytoscape will stick with GML for now; Chris may do the work
on the reader/writer.  BioPax will be used when it is complete.

Other
Video conferencing will be tried out in the next week.
Ryan will correspond with user regarding the Active Modules
bug.  Trey emphasized that the C++ version of the Active Modules plugin will not be supported further. Some bugs were reviewed--Ethan offered to inspect Java/Mac OS X issues further, and bug 'busted' will be dealt with by 
turning on line numbers in the stack trace and adding some 
text to the updated FAQ regarding crashes. If individuals 
want to offer 'areas of expertise' regarding Cytoscape, I'll 
compile for use in assigning bugs.
