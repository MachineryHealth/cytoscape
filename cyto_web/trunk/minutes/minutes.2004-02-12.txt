Cytoscape Meeting:  Thursday Feb 12, 2004
Present:  Trey, Chris, Ethan, Rob, Andrew, and Rowan

1.  GML Reader/Writer:  Chris has checked in a working version of the GML
Reader/Writer.  Not everything is enabled, and he is still working on a
few remaining items.  Primary item is mapping node attributes, including
color, shape, etc.  Chris encountered some problems with the Viz Mapper --
specifically could not get the continuous mapper to work for node/edge
colors.  Chris and Andrew will take this up off line.

2.  Hierarchical Layout:  Rob has the core layout algorithm complete, and
is currently integrating with GINY.  Rob plans to release a beta version
of the algorithm as a plugin either on Friday or this coming Monday.

3.  Filters:  Rowan has a beta version of the Filter plugin, that he made
available in his Mac app distribution.  Based on feedback from Gary,
Rowan is working on fixing the UI so that everything fits within a smaller
screen.

4.  Mac OS X Distribution:  Rowan has made a "Macified" version of
Cytoscape using the Mac OS X Jar Bundler.  The application now looks and
feels like a regular Mac application.  Cool!  Ethan will look into
automating the Mac version as part of our regular ant release process.

5.  Documentation:  Ethan checked in the Cytoscape 2.0 manual.  Andrew is
working on updating the Cytoscape tutorials on the cytoscape.org web site.
