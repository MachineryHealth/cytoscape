Participants: Trey, Owen, Gary, Paul, Andrew, Benno

Topics
------
1.) Visual Mapping
2.) User support for Cytoscape
3.) Undo functionality
4.) yFiles replacement
5.) Miscellaneous

Meeting Minutes
---------------
1.) Visual Mapping
- Owen and Andrew work on the VizMapper that unifies and extends all previous
functionality
- Andrew will check in his changes today so that Owen can work on them from
tomorrow
- Owen's ETA for his changes is 5 work days for a "decent draft" version, and 10
work days for a good version of the code
- It is agreed that the new VizMapper should not be checked into the Core before
its existence as a plugin and thorough inspection of the design by at least one
other Core developer.
- For now, this should be a general requirement to migrate code into the Core
- Large datasets create high memory requirements - it was discussed what
alternatives exist to representing expression data multiple times in memory.
- Owen suggested a solution that sounded wonderful to everyone (including the
minute-taker, who didn't quite understand the details)

2.) User support for Cytoscape
- Paul will massage Owen's example files on the Website into a WebStart-able
form
- Trey will make sure that the bug reporting address "bugs@cytoscape.org" gets a
prominent place on the cytoscape.org Web site.
- We will work towards the sourceforge-supported bug tracking system. Paul will
set up the bug tracking system on sourceforge for a trial run.

3.) Undo functionality
- After Iliana has found a speed problem with the Undo functionality, since
yFiles is generating loads of graph events, that functionality was and should
remain disabled for layout operations for the time being. "When there is time"
it should be fixed.

4.) yFiles replacement
- Rowan Christmas has an API-compatible replacement for yFiles that is based on
a public-domain graph drawing package. Paul will look into the possibility of
replacing yFiles after the cleanup action on the Core.

5.) Miscellaneous
- A problem occurred with Cytoscape URLs that were missing the terminal slash.
Trey is working with the our Web space provider and other concerned parties to
resolve the issue.
- Paul emphasized the desirability of a "data wrangler" and everyone agrees.
Trey mentioned the imminent activities on grant writing to significantly extend
Cytoscape's funding and staffing.
