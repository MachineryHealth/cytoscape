Cytoscape Meeting Minutes
==========================

Date:  		April 29, 2004
Present:  	Rowan, Andrew, Larissa, Iliana, Gary, Rob, Ethan, Try,
Ryan.

Feedback RE:  Cytoscape 2.0
----------------------------

People have started to download the new Cytoscape 2.0.  We are starting to
get some feedback.

1.  AbstractPlugIn Error in JActive Modules.  Now fixed.  New Jar file is
checked in. Jar file needs to be included in next alpha release (to be
done on Monday)

2.  Printing has also been fixed (at least for Linux). However, printing
from Windows is still broken.

3.  Trey and Ryan are working on speeding up the GML Reader.  Trying to
create new nodes/edges in batch mode.

Cytoscape API
----------------------------

1.  Rowan:  made interfaces for CyNetwork, CyWindow, etc.  Should he check
them in, or wait? Do we have any plugins that instantiate a new network,
e.g. cyNetwork = new CyNetwork()? This now needs to be done via a factory
method.  Rowan will check Plugins directory to see if anyone does this,
before checking in.

2.  Unique Identifiers

Decided to deal with nodes and edges at the model layer.  Unique
identifiers will be hidden inside of nodes and edges.  How does the input
file map to the nodes/edges?  GML assigns its own unique identifier.  GML
has an ID and a Label field.  We are currently using the label field as
the canonical name.  GML predifined tags:  id (must be unique), name (not
forced to be unique), label (visual text label for display).

Dataservices should be eventually included in the core.  Data services
will include additional controlled vocabulary terms (to be defined.)

PlugIn Issue(s) / Bugs
----------------------

Can we display two graphs via a split window, and create a PlugIn that can
work on both windows?
Andrew:  we already have a 1.1.1 plugin that can work with two windows.
Rowan:  probably not too hard to port over to Cytoscape 2.0.

Gary:  should we plan what to do with the remaining bugs?
Andrew:  most of the remaining bugs are rather minor.
Ryan:  still some issues with layout (Rowan thinks he has fixed the
specific errors that Ryan found)

Bird's Eye View is not working anymore. Rowan may take the Bird's Eye view
out for a while.  Needs to work on this some more.

Ethan to do new release on Monday.  Gary to use this as the base for
testing and closing all
resolved bugs.
