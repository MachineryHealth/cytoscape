1. Alpha3 - Documentation

In addition to the release, there is the new API ( which will only show 
the supported classes ) as well as some documentation aimed at 
plugin-writers that I wrote ( feedback welecomed ).  Also the pages at 
http://cytoscape.systemsbiology.net/Cytoscape2.0/plugin/index.html have 
been updated, and are geared more at plugin-writers moving to 2.0 from 1.1

2.0 stuff

Creating Nodes:

after talking with Greg we decided that it probably makes sense to leave 
all node creation at the Cytoscape.getCyNode level, but we might add a 
convience method to CyNetwork that delegates to the same method.

When nodes are created, i will look into automatically vizmapping their 
views so that they are not invisible.

Loading Networks:

when you load a network over 500 nodes a View is *not* created by 
default.  You have to go Edit->Create View ( which the dialog box tells 
you... )

Birds-Eye-View:

maybe I will have time next week...

Layout:

DReiss pointed me to some code that I am working on porting.


3. Retreat

in NY, we might also want an entry into the graphdrawing.org symposium 
two days later.
