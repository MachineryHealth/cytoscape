Hi guys,
	I guess we forgot to assign a minute taker yesterday.  Here are some
short notes I took:


Thursday, August 19, 2004 notes

Website:
To edit the website, you don't have to have PHP, but it helps.  PHP is on by
default on the Mac, so it is pretty easy to edit if you have a Mac.  Next
easiest to use is Linux, since it is usually pre-installed, but might not be
on.  Then Windows, where it is not installed, but available.

When we use open source libraries, they might require a license file to be
distributed.  We should have a section of our future developer site devoted
to useful open source libraries that have been tested to work with
Cytoscpae.

GraphObjAttributes refactoring - Rowan is building some new classes as a
proposal.

Conference agenda items
-Tutorial and documentation

Data structures - annotations vs. attributes division. Data services and
data models.

-Build process - build.xml, targets, etc. should we split up build.xml to
make it easier to deal with.

-Anonymous CVS access. + build process.

-Plugins expose - talk about all the different plugins - maybe some of them
would end up as core.

Focus areas of the developer team - what focus groups should be defined.

Gary will soon update the retreat webpage with a detailed agenda and let
everyone know.
