*No meeting next week due to holiday, have a good Thanksgiving.
*Proposed new time for weekly meeting: Thursday 2 PM PST/5 PM EST

present: GB, EC, CW, BS, AM, RC, PE

Refactor Status:
-AM wanted to release new version for review last week, but a yFiles
problem (disappearing edges) prevented it.
-is load time slower with GINY than yFiles?  Opined: slower on Windows,
faster on Mac.
-RC to recheck GINY jars for compile problems
-profiling and performace testing: Some has been done, RC believes there
may not be any more optimization to get out of the lib
-20K edges didn't load for CW
-request made for large graph data (thanks CW)
-GINY vs YFiles--memory: more or less similar, GINY maybe slightly less
-checking for Java memory leaks? Profiler needed (jProfiler ~$200,
OptimizeIt ~$1K). mskcc and/or ucsd may purchase.

yFiles:
-when to remove it and be open source?  Options: 1. not dump until GINY
has been well-tested, or 2. get rid of YFiles to test GINY.  Possibly
move to plugin?
-rewrite of plugins ongoing.
-Cy1.1 to stay around for a while, dev work on Cy2.0
-RC currently fixing node related bugs.

Osprey:
-people too busy for new releases, might like to combine efforts.  GB
and possibly John Aitchison (ISB) to talk with them about future.

Beta Release:
-new build files done
-release on beta page, will copy over to public when given the green
light

Plugins Dir:
-CVS dir 5: organization needed (currently copy of dir4, so rm *,
including plugins)
-organize by group (mskcc, isb, ucsd, common), people's names w/i these
dirs (CW to create)
-only GINY plugins in CVS dir 5
-all plugins should have a person's name attached (readme or author
file)
-need for a plugins 'yellow pages'
1. what does it do?
2. who wrote it?
-a plan for unmaintained plugins: check to see if they run.  AM to
resend list, Iliana may also have some info.  Paul may have some to
claim.  Those copied to CVS dir 5 may implicitly be keepers.

Headless Mode:
-problems: error msgs and other
-option: module-ize Cytoscape, control with other software (eg scripting
lang)
-question: should it be engineered now, or would it be better to wait
for later release?   Agreed decision: wait for later, but begin
planning/designing now.

Cytoscape Hosting:
-mskcc has capacity and personnel to host cytoscape.org if needed

Bugs: 
70/33 -> Larissa to check installer issues with Mozilla/Linux combo
78/71 -> PE to update FAQ for Mac users about a fix for starting from Cy
icon.
