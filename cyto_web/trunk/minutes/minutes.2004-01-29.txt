Release:
-Cytoscape manual
1. references to the 'read-only/edit/delete' submenus will be removed
from the manual
2. a decision regarding layout and algorithm picking will be deferred
for input from LK and RC 
3. the active modules section will be done away with, a reference to
plugin documentation will take its place.
The manual will focus on the core, and will be in PDF and Word formats.
Ethan is working on it and will send it around for additions/editing in
the coming days.

Status:
-GML
The problem: layout info and graph info were in the same object in
yFiles, but with GINY, layout info is not in graph.  It was agreed that
a solution is needed even if it's not permanent. A possibility is to
reuse class GraphObjAttributes as something like 'GraphObjLayout'. Data
structure and implementation details are to be worked out further, esp.
with input from Rowan and Larissa.
-Hierarchical Layout
The Sugiyama algorithm has 4 stages.  Rob is finishing and testing the
first (cycle elimination).  He'll then proceed with further steps, with
an eye on the 2.0 release.  Core algorithm will need to be integrated
with GINY further. The completion date will be better known next week.

Gary asked the question, "How finished is the current Cytoscape vis a
vis testing/bugs/etc?"  Andrew had left the room, but later said that
the outstanding items of GML, filters, and layout should be discussed
next week in preparation for deep testing.
