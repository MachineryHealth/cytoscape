Editors note: no actual meeting today. Enclosed are some emails
covering Cytoscape issues, first from Trey responding to Gary.
------------------------------------------------------------------

This is great that you have hired a programmer, Gary. 
I must actually also apologize that my group will not be
able to meet today- there is an all day Whitehead shindig
that we have to attend, unfortunately.  Owen is out of
town today anyway, but will be back next week.

My issues to report are that:

(1) Benno, Gary, and I are making progress off-line on identifying 
a suitable grant application.  Depending on which one we go for,
it looks like the submission deadline for this will be June 1st,
which means we should be writing this thing by mid April.

(2) Can we agree on a time for the next major release of
the Core? It would hopefully be between now and the time
the Cytoscape paper will come out (assuming it makes it through
the remaining hoops) at the beginning of April. 

(3) I would like to agree on what should be in that release.
I would imagine it including the tutorials Paul is working on,
the new visual mapping system, and, in response to some of
Gary's comments, an extensive help system,
accessible from the website and the application itself,
javadoc for the code, ... shall I keep dreaming?  ;)

(4) Speaking of the visual mapper, check it out!!

(5) Paul, I thought the tutorial looked like a good start. 
You have somehow fixed the bug I was getting before with
launching javastart. The only comment I currently have is that
I think calling Cytoscape "a software platform for
computational biology and bioinformatics" is too general. In
fact, since we are talking about linking this page from the main
cytoscape website anyway, what about titling this page
"Cytoscape Tutorials" or something like that?

Cheers, Trey
