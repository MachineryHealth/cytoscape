Minutes for Cytoscape conference call Thursday, June 17, 2004

Attendance:
Ethan, Gary, Rob, Andrew, Rowan, Chris, Ryan

Web page:
Weston Whittaker, one of MSKCC's summer students is making a minor update to
the web page on a low priority basis - specifically the news, links,
screenshots and dev page have been updated.  This will be uploaded tomorrow
or early next week.

Testing: Gary is finally ready to do another testing round on Cytoscape. 
He will create a new release before testing.

cPath is ready for installing and testing.  cPath is a lightweight
protein-protein interaction DB from MSKCC.  You can download a nightly CVS
snapshot from here:

Trey requested a dialog to save attributes to a file. Ryan wrote a plugin to
do this - he will send it out to the list for testing and possible inclusion
in the core.

Ryan - other issues:
Unique aliases for nodes - vizmapper relies on canonical name, but it
shouldn't be using this.  We have agreed to move to a Node and Edge object
lookup scheme for all API calls.  Rowan will update this after the release
so avoid introducing bugs before the release.
