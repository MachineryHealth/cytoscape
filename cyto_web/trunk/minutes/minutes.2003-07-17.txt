Cytoscape Meeting, 7/17/03

Pressent: Rowan, Iliana, Paul, Larissa, Benno, Andrew, Ethan, Jonathon, 
Trey, Chris

This meeting was focused on the re-org.

1. ) Stuff
Thanks to Ethan for doing this much needed task. To accomplish the 
re-org Ethan wrote a perl script to move everything around, and back it up.
Things to note:
--OLD Cytoscape: cvsdir2
--NEW Cytoscape: cvsdir4
There were a few now-fixed ant issues, 1) dialogs not compiling, 2) data 
server stuff.  The new scripts work on OS X, Win32, and IA32.  There 
were some issues with an Itanium, Rowan is going to try to run it on a 
Sun UltraSparcIII, this should tell us if the problem is a 64-bit 
problem, or an Itanium problem, if anyone has an Opteron lying around we 
could try that to.

2.) Plugins
Lots of discussion on how to do plugins.  What was decided is that 
plugins will continue to live in csplugins, but will be changed to use 
ant for building.  Each plugin that makes use of Y-Files and needs to 
obfuscate will be given a boilerplate build.xml file to get one 
started.  Ethan will provide an example plugin that has this build.xml 
file.
<Rowan Thoughts>
I feel that each plugin should be able to make their own jar file, and 
put it into the common cytoscape/lib directory.  The dist builder could 
then put all of them into cytoscape.jar for distribution, or not.
</Rowan Thoughts>

2.A) Plugins that don't compile
There are 38 plugins, 14 don't compile.  Everyone needs to claim their 
plugins or they will be taken out of active development.  One should 
email the list which are yours, Iliana will then compile those lists.

2.B) Future Plugin re-org
A few ideas for re-organizing plugins.
1: Put them under cytoscape:
/cytoscape/plugins/
/cytoscape/plugins/myplugin/
/cytoscape/plugins/myplugin/build.xml
/cytoscape/plugins/myplugin/src/
/cytoscape/plugins/myplugin/src/myplugin/
/cytoscape/plugins/myplugin/src/myplugin/*.java
--The namespace for your plugin would be:
package myplugin;


2: As they are now:
/csplugins/
/csplugins/myplugin/
/csplugins/myplugin/build.xml
/csplugins/myplugin/*.java
--The namespace for your plugin would be:
package csplugins.myplugin;

3: With user dirs
/csplugins/
/csplugins/xmas/
/csplugins/xmas/myplugin/
/csplugins/xmas/myplugin/build.xml
/csplugins/xmas/myplugin/src/
/csplugins/xmas/myplugin/src/xmas/
/csplugins/xmas/myplugin/src/xmas/myplugin/
/csplugins/xmas/myplugin/src/xmas/myplugin/*.java
--The namespace for your plugin would be:
package xmas.myplugin

Option 3 would have a common "csplugins" dir for common plugins, where 
"csplugins" would be like "xmas" in the above example.

3) A Few ant questions
Paul and Ethan will add in RMI stuff, which is Ethan assures us is easy 
to do.  Paul/Ethan/Andrew/( maybe Rowan) will look into making more ant 
targets to be able to test individual tests ( i.e. just the dialog test ).

Ethan noted that *some* people like to use "IDE's", the rest of the 
group was unsure what he was talking about and retreated back to using 
checking their E-mail on Emacs, writing their code on Emacs, using the 
Emacs terminal, and then getting help from the Emacs Psychiatrist ( 
R:"I'm sick, Dave." EP:"Maybe your life have something to do with this." 
).  Ethan was then able to run tests in directories and do other neat stuff.

4) CLI Cytoscape
Chris asked about how people used the command line, Iliana loaded files 
and stuff with it.  Rowan shared that he has though about how to make 
Cytoscape more command line friendly.  Trey mentioned that he would like 
to be able to run stuff all on the command line and then choose between 
interactive and non-interactive views ( maybe Post-Script? ).

5) Ethan Mentioned that ant --projecthelp will list all the ant targets.

6) Re-factor
Andrew will be using cvsdir5 for his refactor stuff, it will be a 
cvsdir4 copy initially.  Andrew has made the current "CytoscapeWindow" 
class be more of a list of pointers to other objects.  He is still 
working on it and hopes to be done in a few weeks, at which time we will 
begin replacing Y-Files.

7) GINY Graph INterface librarY
Rowan is working on this, do a "cvs co giny" from 
sourceforge.net/projects/csbi, ask him for help, phone (206) 732-1328, 
IM: rowanxmas.

8) Retreat
29-30 of August
Trey and Chris will stay with Benno.
Gary and Ethan will stay with Rowan, who hopes that they like beer.

9) First annual Cytoscape Bug Parade
Jonathon will take the Vizmapper bug, since he wrote the code.  It'll 
take at least a week for him to really do anything about it due to 
slave-driving from Trey.
DataServices bugs will be assinged to Ethan and Gary
Star nodes to Larissa
and some Did-Not-Compile ones to Paul.
