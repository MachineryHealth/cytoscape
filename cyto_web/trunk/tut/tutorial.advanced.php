<h2>Cytoscape Advanced Tutorials</h2>
</center>

Some of the most interesting functionality available with Cytoscape
comes from external plugins, which can be developed by anyone with a 
certain degree of Java programming skill.

<p>

This set of web pages contains a set of tutorials for advanced operation of
Cytoscape, especially using selected plugins. Before starting these tutorials,
we recommend that you first run through the 
<a href="tutorial.php">introductory</a> tutorials.  While all of the 
introductory tutorials can be executed using 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/information/javawebstart.html"> Java Web Start</a>, the advanced tutorials cannot, for compliance with the 
redistribution terms of many plugins' user agreements.  Note that all plugins
covered in these tutorials are freely-available, as is Cytoscape.  
<p>
To execute the advanced tutorials, you will first need to install Cytoscape
(and any required plugins) on your local system.  The 
<a href="../manual/Cytoscape2_2Manual.pdf">Cytoscape manual</a> includes
instructions for installing Cytoscape.  All plugins described are available
through the Cytoscape <a href="../plugins2.php">plugins</a> page.  Most plugins
can be installed by downloading the plugin JAR files and copying them to
the <b>plugins</b> subdirectory of your Cytoscape directory.  For some 
plugins, special download links are provided, to detailing specific 
installation steps.  Each tutorial lists the required plugins, and outlines
the installation procedure in detail.  
<p>
Note that for those interested in writing plugins, there is a 
<a href="../pluginTutorial.php">tutorial</a> on writing Cytoscape plugins.
<p>
The following web browsers 
are supported for these tutorials:<BR>
<ul>
  <li> Netscape 5.0 or later
  <li> Internet Explorer 5.0 or later
  <li> Mozilla 6.0 or later
</ul>
