				<h2>Cytoscape Tutorial Introduction</h2>
			</center>
			<p><strong><font color="red"><u>
			Note: Some sections of this tutorial are based on version 2.2 and not up-to-date.  We will update 
this for the latest version shortly.</u></font></strong></p>
			Cytoscape is an open-source package for visualization and analysis of 
biological network data.  Cytoscape's core functionality includes methods for 
automated graph layout, integrating network data with other data such as 
expression data and Gene Ontology annotations, and setting visual attributes 
according tonode or edge attributes.  In addition, Cytoscape offers an open
plugin architecture, allowing anyone to add functionality by writing a plugin, 
and maintains a library of available third-party plugins.  There are 
currently plugins available for topics such as literature searching and 
module detection.
			<p>   

These pages contain a set of tutorials to serve as an introduction to Cytoscape and its plugins.  
The first group describes Cytoscape's core functionality.  
Using <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/information/javawebstart.html"> Java Web Start</a>, 
you may run these tutorials on your personal computer without any need to install Cytoscape.  Be aware that there are security issues with Java Web Start, as we have described on a <a href="../tut_security.php">related page</a>.  
Java Web Start should work by default after it is installed on Windows and 
Mac OSX.&nbsp; On Linux, some extra set-up steps
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/download-linux.html">
steps</a> may be required.</p>
			<p>

A <a href="tutorial.advanced.php">second group</a> of tutorials describes
advanced operation of Cytoscape, with emphasis on selected plugins.  While all
the plugins described are freely available, many require a user agreement, some
of which preclude redistribution.  Thus, Java Web Start is not available for
this group, although instructions are provided for installing Cytoscape and
its plugins on your local computer.
