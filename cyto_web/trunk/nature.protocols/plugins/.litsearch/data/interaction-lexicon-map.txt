# This file maps a list of interaction lexicon names to the files that
# defined each such named lexicon.  The format is a TAB-delimited list
# of two columns where each row represents one lexicon mapping. The
# first column is the name of the interaction lexicon and represents the
# name displayed within the dropdown menu for "Interaaction Lexicon:". The
# second column is the file path, relative to the LitSearch home, that
# defines this lexicon.
#
# Comments start with a '#' in the first non-whitspace character.
