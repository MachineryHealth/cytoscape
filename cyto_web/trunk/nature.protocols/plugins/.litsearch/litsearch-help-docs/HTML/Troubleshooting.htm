<H1>Troubleshooting</H1>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As stated in the <A 
href="Agilent_Literature_Search_License_Agreement.htm">Agilent Literature Search 
License Agreement</A>, <EM>Agilent Literature Search </EM>is provided without 
support.&nbsp; </P>
<P>However, here are some useful hints for dealing with potential problems that 
may occur.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>Agilent Literature Search does not show up on Cytoscape plugins menu.</H3>
<P>Check to see that the file <FONT face=Courier>Litsearch_plugin.jar<FONT 
face=Arial> exists in Cytoscape's plugin directory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 
possible that you may have installed <EM>Agilent Literature Search </EM>to the 
wrong directory.&nbsp; If that is the case, move the <FONT 
face=Courier>Litsearch_plugin.jar <FONT face=Arial>file to Cytoscape's plugin 
directory.&nbsp; When in doubt, run the installation 
again.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>A Search Engine Not Found Warning Appears </H3>
<P>It is likely that your proxy settings are incorrect.&nbsp; Check them via the 
<STRONG>Edit -&gt; Preferences </STRONG>menu item.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>Search Engine Performance is Slow</H3>
<P>USPTO and OMIM search engines can be slow, particularly during daytime 
hours.&nbsp; An alternative is to try longer searches during evening hours.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>You get different results from multiple search executions</H3>
<P><EM>Agilent Literature Search </EM>performs run-time aliasing and adds the 
new aliases to its data structure.&nbsp; You may get different results on 
multiple runs when you <STRONG>use aliases.&nbsp; </STRONG>We provide the 
aliases in the <EM><A href="Concept_Lexicon.htm">concept lexicon</A> </EM>files 
as a utility.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They may not work for your specific needs, in 
which case you should edit the <EM><A href="Concept_Lexicon.htm">concept 
lexicon</A> </EM>files to provide aliases that work for you.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>Lexicon and/or Settings files not found</H3>
<P><EM>Agilent Literature Search </EM>utilizes a number of 
settings, configuration, and data files which are installed into the folder 
<FONT 
face=Courier>&lt;user.home&gt;/.litsearch/data/</FONT>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If the creation of this folder of copying of these files fails for any reason, 
e.g. permissions problems, then <EM>Agilent Literature Search </EM>will not 
operate properly.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should check that file permissions are set to 
allow files to be written to your <FONT face=Courier>&lt;user.home&gt; <FONT 
face=Arial>folder (on Microsoft Windows systems this will often be 
<FONT face=Courier>C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;your user name&gt; <FONT 
face=Arial>).&nbsp; Then re-install <EM>Agilent Literature 
Search.</EM></FONT></FONT> </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<H3><BR>When&nbsp;you do a search, a warning dialog pops up saying "Engines 
Unavailable".</H3>
<P>Possible Causes: The engine(s) are actually not available (e.g., heavy load, 
down for maintenence, etc.), your proxy settings are incorrect, your connection 
to the Internet is not working.</P>
<P>Solutions:</P>
<P>1) First check that your internet connection is working by trying to browse 
to a page. Use your browser's "refresh" button for the page, to ensure your 
browser has not locally cached the page. </P>
<P>2) If your Internet connection is working, ensure your proxy settings are 
correct within <EM>Agilent Literature Search</EM>. Your proxy settings are 
correct, if you got some results from other search engines. In this case, go to 
step 4. If you only searched using one search engine, retry your search with all 
three engines selected (use <STRONG>View--&gt;Engine Selections</STRONG>). If 
you *don't* &nbsp;get an engine down message for any of the other engines, then 
see step 4.&nbsp; If all engines return the "Engines Unavailable" warning, see 
step 3.</P>
<P>3) If you use a proxy server to connect to the Internet, ensure your proxy 
settings are correct within <EM>Agilent Literature Search</EM>. Use your 
Internet browser proxy settings for <EM>Agilent Literature Search</EM>. If you 
are not sure if you use a proxy server, then check with your System 
Administrator. Set your <EM>Agilent Literature Search </EM>proxy settings using 
the <STRONG>Edit--&gt;Preferences...</STRONG> menu, Internet tab.</P>
<P>4) Your engine(s) of interest are probably truly unavailable.&nbsp; Retry 
your search later.<BR></P>

<H4><BR>  
        Engines Unavailable</H4>
<P>Items under this heading are the names of the engines 
that <EM>Agilent Literature Search</EM> could not communicate with (see troubleshooting question).</P>

<H4>  
        Unreadable Matches</H4>
<P>Items under this heading are the URLs of the matches 
found that could not be read. This may be caused by the search engine becoming 
unavailable, or your internet connection failing *after* <EM>Agilent Literature 
Search </EM>initially gathered matches from the search engines. Items under this 
heading imply your proxy setting *are correct*--no need to check them.</P>
<H4><BR>  
       Maximum Documents Exceeded</H4>
<P>Items under this heading are the names of the engines 
where you have exceeded your document limit for that engine.&nbsp; The document 
limit is the total number of matching documents that can be returned for a 
search from that search engine. To avoid this, split up your searches into 
smaller pieces with a smaller value for <STRONG>'Max Engine 
Matches'</STRONG>
