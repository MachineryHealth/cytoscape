<H1>Welcome to Agilent Literature Search</H1>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=bodycopy><EM>Agilent Literature Search</EM>   is a meta-search tool for 
automatically querying multiple text-based search engines (both public and 
proprietary) in order to aid biologists faced with the daunting task of manually 
searching and extracting associations among genes/proteins of interest. </P>
<P class=bodycopy>Agilent Literature Search can be used in conjunction with <A 
target=_blank href="http://www.cytoscape.org/index.php">Cytoscape</A> v2.3, 
which provides a means of generating an overview network view of gene/protein 
associations.</P>

<P class=bodycopy><EM>Agilent Literature Search</EM> provides           an 
easy-to-use interface to its powerful search capabilities. A set of queries 
can be defined interactively, then submitted to multiple user-selected search engines.&nbsp; The 
retrieved results (documents) are fetched from their respective sources and 
each document is then parsed into sentences and analyzed for protein-protein 
associations. <EM>Agilent Literature Search</EM> uses a set of&nbsp;<EM><A 
href="Working_with_Lexicons.htm">lexicons</A></EM>        for defining protein names      
           
           
          
          
    (and aliases) and association terms (verbs) of 
interest. An association is extracted for every sentence containing at least 
two protein names and one verb.&nbsp; Associations&nbsp;&nbsp;are then converted into 
<EM>interactions</EM>, which are further grouped into a 
network. The sentences and source hyperlinks for each association are further 
stored as attributes of the corresponding <EM>interactions</EM>
