<H1>Installation</H1>
<P>You can install <EM>Agilent Literature Search</EM> from the Web page at <A 
href="http://www.cytoscape.org/download_agilent_literature_search_v2.3.php?file=litsearch_v2.3">
http://www.cytoscape.org/download_agilent_literature_search_v2.3.php?file=litsearch_v2.3</A>.</P>
<P>Follow the instructions given by the <EM>InstallAnywhere </EM>process that is 
invoked when you select the link to download <EM>Agilent Literature 
Search.&nbsp; </EM></P>
<P>You will be prompted to accept the <A 
href="Agilent_Literature_Search_License_Agreement.htm">Agilent Technologies 
Software License Agreement</A> in order to continue installing <EM>Agilent 
Literature Search.&nbsp; </EM></P>
<P>You will also be asked to choose a directory for installing <EM>Agilent 
Literature Search.&nbsp; </EM>You should choose the <EM>plugins </EM>directory 
in wherever you have installed Cytoscape.</P>
<P>The installer will copy a num ber of files into a directory called .<FONT 
face=Courier>litsearch<FONT face=Arial>, which is created under your <FONT 
face=Courier>&lt;user.home&gt;</FONT> directory.&nbsp; You will not need to 
alter any of these files unless you want to customize the behavior of 
<EM>Agilent Literature Search.&nbsp; </EM>This is discussed in the sections on 
<A href="Configuring_literature_search.htm">Configuring Literature Search</A>, and <A href="Working_with_Lexicons.htm">Working with 
Lexicons</A>     .

<H3>Uninstalling Agilent Literature Search</H3>
<P>When you install <EM>Agilent Literature Search, </EM>an uninstaller program is also installed into the 
directory <FONT 
face=Courier>&lt;user.home&gt;/.litsearch/.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT> 
 &nbsp;There will be a file in that directory named</P>
<P><FONT face=Courier>Uninstall 
Agilent_Literature_Search.exe</FONT></P>
<P>If you execute that file, then the <EM>Agilent Literature 
Search </EM>plugin and all of its associated files will be removed from the 
system.&nbsp; Note, however, that the uninstaller will <U>not</U> delete any 
files that were <U>not </U>created by the installer.&nbsp; So, for example, it 
will not delete any literature search network files that you may have 
saved.&nbsp; If you want to delete such files, you will need to do that 
manually.</P>
