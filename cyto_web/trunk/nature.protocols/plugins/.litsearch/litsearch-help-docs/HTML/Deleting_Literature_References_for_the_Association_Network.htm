<H1>Deleting Literature References for the Association Network</H1>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As you examine the literature references for an association network, you may 
find it useful to delete certain sentences -- or entire references -- from the 
network.&nbsp; This could be done, for example,&nbsp;for references that you 
consider not as credible or not providing strong support for the putative 
network.&nbsp; </P>
<P>You can delete a sentence from a displayed list of sentences by right-mouse 
clicking and selecting <STRONG>Delete Sentence 
</STRONG>from the menu that pops up&nbsp; (<FONT >see figure 
below</FONT>).&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 
src="../Images/deleteMapk3Sentence.png" border=0></P>
<P>Note that when you delete a sentence, <STRONG>all 
</STRONG>copies of that sentence are deleted from the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
(Note also that in this version of <EM>Agilent Literature 
Search, </EM>any sentence panels showing the deleted sentence are <STRONG>not </STRONG>automatically updated to reflect the deletion 
of that sentence.&nbsp; However, any sentence panels that are displayed after 
the deletion of the sentence will correctly reflect the deletion of that 
sentence, i.e. they will <STRONG>not </STRONG>show that 
sentence).&nbsp; </P>
<P><EM>Agilent Literature Search 
</EM>associates each sentence with a "source".&nbsp; The source is the reference 
document in which that sentence appears.&nbsp; There can be multiple sentences 
for a source.&nbsp; When all sentences associated with a source are deleted, 
then that source is automatically deleted.&nbsp; Sources and sentences are, in 
turn, associated with Cytoscape edges.&nbsp; When all sources associated with an 
edge are deleted, then <EM>Agilent Literature Search 
</EM>will delete that edge from the system.&nbsp; When the edge is deleted, any 
nodes for that edge are checked to see what edges they are connected to.&nbsp; 
If the deleted edge is the only edge that a node is connected to, then that node 
is deleted, as well.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>You can delete an entire reference from a network by 
right-mouse clicking on an entry in the <STRONG>Query Matches </STRONG>panel and 
selecting <STRONG>Delete Match </STRONG>from the menu 
that pops up&nbsp; (see figure below).</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../Images/deleteFromQueryMatches.png" 
border=0></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When all references associated with an edge are deleted, 
then <EM>Agilent Literature Search </EM>will delete that 
edge from the system.&nbsp; When the edge is deleted, any nodes for that edge 
are checked to see what edges they are connected to.&nbsp; If the deleted edge 
is the only edge that a node is connected to, then that node is deleted, as 
well.</P>
