<H1>Pausing, continuing, and aborting search</H1>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>PAUSE</H3><FONT size=2>
<P><STRONG>Pause</STRONG> will temporarily stop execution of your search and 
displays partial results. It is useful for temporarily reducing system resources 
on your computer so you can perform other tasks. It is also useful for 
performing large queries that my require you to run over the course of several 
ALS sessions and may extend over several days. When you <STRONG>pause</STRONG>, 
you are given the option to continue your query&nbsp;the next time you run ALS 
(multi-session queries). Taking this option will cause ALS to save some 
information in files so that the next time you run ALS, it will immediately 
continue executing your query. Not taking this option will allow you to only 
finish your query during your current ALS session. Multi-sesson query 
information is removed when a query completes normally, or&nbsp; when the 
multi-session option is used on a new query.</P>
<P>During a <STRONG>pause</STRONG>, you are not allowed to modify any of your 
search characteristics until your query is completed or until you abort your 
search. This is made clear by fact that all your various search controls are 
disabled while you are <STRONG>paused</STRONG>.</P>
<P><STRONG>Pause</STRONG> is only available during certain times during 
execution of your search. It is currently available from the time that all query 
match URLs have been gathered (called unread results) until the start of the 
final merging phase.</P>
<P>Depending on when you <STRONG>pause</STRONG>, the partial results displayed 
in the <STRONG>Query</STRONG> <STRONG>Matches</STRONG> panel may include query 
matches in three states: <EM>Completed</EM>, <EM>Not Yet Analyzed</EM>, and 
<EM>Unread</EM>. </P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <DIV><FONT size=3><EM>Completed:</EM> results are fully read in and all 
  matches have been analyzed, </FONT></DIV></LI>
  <LI>
  <DIV><FONT size=3><FONT><EM>Not Yet Analyzed</EM>: matches whose 
  </FONT>content has been read in, but haven't been analyzed yet, and 
  </FONT></DIV></LI>
  <LI>
  <DIV><FONT size=3><EM>Unread</EM>: matches for which the content has not yet 
  been read in.</FONT></DIV></LI></UL>
<P>The results will be ordered from most complete to least complete and the 
order of the matches will follow the order returned by the search engines.</P>
<P>You can continue your query by pressing the <STRONG>Continue</STRONG> 
button.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></FONT>
<H3>CONTINUE</H3><FONT size=2>
<P>Resumes execution of a search. The search begins execution from where it left 
off. Once execution resumes, you can once again <STRONG>pause</STRONG> the 
search.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></FONT>
<H3>ABORT</H3><FONT size=2>
<P>Permanently stops execution of your search and displays partial results. The 
partial results show are like those described for <STRONG>Pause</STRONG>. Unlike 
<STRONG>Pause</STRONG>, <STRONG>Abort</STRONG> is available during all phases of 
the search process. Also, after an <STRONG>abort</STRONG> you are free to modify 
your search characteristics and enter a new query 
(<STRONG>Fetch</STRONG>).</P></FONT>
