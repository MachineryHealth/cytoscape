<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When you press the <STRONG>Fetch </STRONG>&nbsp; <IMG height=16 hspace=0 
src="../Images/VCRPlay.gif" width=16 border=0>&nbsp;button, the set of queries 
in the <STRONG>Query Editor </STRONG>is submitted to multiple user-selected 
search engines.&nbsp; The retrieved results (documents) are fetched from their 
respective sources and each document is then parsed into sentences and analyzed 
for concept associations (e.g. protein-protein associations). <EM>Agilent 
Literature Search</EM> uses a set of&nbsp;<EM><A 
href="Working_with_Lexicons.htm">lexicons</A></EM> for defining concept names 
(and aliases) and association terms (verbs) of interest. The <EM><A 
href="Concept_Lexicon.htm">concept lexicon</A> </EM>supplied with this version 
of <EM>Agilent Literature Search </EM>contains gene/protein names and 
aliases.&nbsp; An association is extracted for every sentence containing at 
least two concept names and one verb.&nbsp; Associations&nbsp;&nbsp;are then 
converted into <EM>interactions</EM>, which are further grouped into a network. 
The sentences and source hyperlinks for each association are further stored as 
attributes of the corresponding <EM>interactions</EM> .<EM><FONT 
color=#ff0000></FONT></EM> </P>
<P>Every sentence is tokenized into words and stemmed. The stemmed words are 
filtered using a dictionary of common English words, which is based on the 
dictionary provided with the UNIX operating system.&nbsp; All the words in the 
text document that match a user context term are marked as potential entities of 
interest. </P>
<P><EM>Agilent Literature Search</EM>   uses two&nbsp;<A

<UL>
  <LI>one &nbsp;for defining protein names and their aliases 
  (<EM>nouns</EM>)&nbsp; 
  <LI>one for defining association terms (<EM>verbs</EM>) of interest. </LI></UL>
<P>An association is extracted for every sentence containing 
at least two <EM>nouns</EM> and one <EM>verb </EM>that are contained in the 
<EM><A href="Working_with_Lexicons.htm">lexicons</A></EM>           
    &nbsp;.&nbsp; Associations&nbsp;&nbsp;are then converted 
into <EM>interactions</EM>, which are further grouped into a network.
