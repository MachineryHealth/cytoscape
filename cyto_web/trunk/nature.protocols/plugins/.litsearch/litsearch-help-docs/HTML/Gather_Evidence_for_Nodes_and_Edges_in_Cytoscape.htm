<H1>Gather Evidence for Nodes and Edges in Cytoscape</H1>
<P>&nbsp;</P>For any Node in the Cytoscape network diagram 
and for any <EM>Edge</EM> between <EM>Nodes</EM>, you can gather fresh evidence for the corresponding Edges from the scientific literature. There are two ways do this. The first way is to 
<OL>
<li> bring up the context menu on a <EM>Node</EM> or 
  <EM>Edge</EM> in the <EM>Network</EM>              (e.g. by right-clicking in
Windows	systems). 
<li> select the <STRONG>Evidence from 
  Literature-&gt;Gather Evidence from the Literature</STRONG> menu item.</li></OL>
<P>This is illustrated in the figure below. </P>

The second way to view literature references is   
to:
<ol>
<li>select either a <EM>Node</EM> or an <EM>Edge</EM>       in the 
Network
<li>On the <STRONG>Select </STRONG>menu, select the 
  <STRONG>Evidence from Literature-&gt; Gather Evidence from the 
  Literature</STRONG> menu item.</li>              

</ol>
<p>

<p>
For either of these methods, a list of query terms (one 
for each selected <EM>Edge</EM>&nbsp;or&nbsp;one for each <EM>Edge 
</EM>&nbsp;adjacent to each selected <EM>Node</EM>) will 
be sent to Pubmed, up to 10 abstracts fetched for each query, and any 
associations among the <EM>Nodes</EM> impinging on the corresponding <EM>Edges</EM> will be 
attached as evidence on the respective <EM>Edge</EM>. By default the 
<STRONG>canonicalName</STRONG> attribute is used to identify the gene 
symbol.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<P>You can select a different attribute by editing the preferences (via 
<STRONG>Edit-&gt;Preferences…),</STRONG> and changing the attribute name 
associated with the <STRONG>litSearchEvidenceAttributeName</STRONG> entry.
If the attribute doesn't exist, you may create a new attribute. Please note 
that the attribute name is case sensitive.
