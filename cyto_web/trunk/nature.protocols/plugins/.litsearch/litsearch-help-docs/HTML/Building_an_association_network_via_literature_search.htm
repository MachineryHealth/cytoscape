<H1>Building an association network via literature search</H1>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To execute a search, you enter a set of <A 
href="Entering_search_terms.htm">search terms</A>&nbsp;and, optionally,&nbsp;<A 
href="Entering_context.htm">context</A> words.&nbsp; For each search term 
entered, a query line is constructed in the <STRONG>Query Editor </STRONG>panel, 
incorporating aliases and context, if desired.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some definitions are 
in order:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>Term</H3>
<P>A term is a concept that you want to search for.&nbsp; 
This is typically a biological entity, such as a protein, gene, or metabolite, 
but it can also be a biological process, a disease, or any other construct you 
are interested in.&nbsp; <STRONG>Terms </STRONG>are entered in the <A 
href="Entering_search_terms.htm"><STRONG>Terms </STRONG>panel</A> of <EM>Agilent Literature 
Search.</EM>               
               
           </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>Context</H3>
<P>Context is used to refine and narrow the scope of the 
search, to enable <EM>Agilent Literature Search </EM>automatically sift through the potentially large corpus 
of search results to quickly identify information of interest to you.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Context can include any words of interest to you, typically a biological 
process, molecular function, or disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Context&nbsp;words are entered in the&nbsp; 
<A href="Entering_context.htm">      <STRONG>Context 
</STRONG>panel</A> of <EM>Agilent Literature Search.&nbsp; </EM>      </P>
<P><EM></EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P>      </P>
<H3>    Query String </H3>
<P>Query strings&nbsp;are the actual queries &nbsp;that are 
sent to the search engines.&nbsp; Query strings are built up in the 
<STRONG>Query Editor </STRONG>panel of <EM>Agilent Literature Search </EM>as 
terms and context words are added in the <STRONG>Terms </STRONG>and 
<STRONG>Context </STRONG>panels.&nbsp;&nbsp; For each line of terms in the 
<STRONG>Terms </STRONG>panel a query string is built up in the <STRONG>Query 
Editor</STRONG>     .&nbsp; </P>
<P>If multiple terms appear on the same line (a phrase), 
<EM>Agilent Literature Search </EM>passes the terms to the search engines 
without interpretation.&nbsp; The interpretation of the phrase is left to the 
semantics of the specific search engines.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the terms </P>
<P><FONT face=Courier>beta catenin</FONT>      </P>
<P>when entered in the <STRONG>Terms </STRONG>  
panel with aliasing turned off, will be sent as </P>
<P><FONT face=Courier>      
   beta&nbsp;catenin</FONT>  
         </P>
<P>   to the search engines.&nbsp; PubMed and OMIM will handle 
such phrases.&nbsp; However, USPTO requires that multi-word phrases be in quotes 
or be separated by boolean terms, like AND, OR, etc.&nbsp; We recommend using 
quotes around multi-word phrases, e.g. </P>
<P><FONT face=Courier>"beta catenin"</FONT>      </P>
<P><EM>Agilent Literature Search </EM>provides as a utility 
a set of organism-specific aliases, contained in the <EM>concept lexicon 
</EM>files.&nbsp; When terms are entered with aliasing turned on, the aliases 
are inserted into the query string in a disjunctive manner.&nbsp;&nbsp; For 
example, the term <EM>nfkb, </EM>when entered in the <STRONG>Terms 
</STRONG>panel with aliasing turned on, will generate the query string      </P>
<P>("nf-kappa b" OR nfkb-1 OR nfkappab OR nfkb OR nf-kappab 
OR "nfkappa b")      </P>
<P>Note that multi-word aliases are automatically enclosed 
in quotes.      </P>
<P>Each line of terms in the <STRONG>Terms </STRONG>panel 
results in one query string.&nbsp; If context is used, then each line of the 
<STRONG>Context </STRONG>panel is combined with each query string.&nbsp; 
Multiple context lines are combined in&nbsp;a disjunctive (OR) fashion.&nbsp; 
For example, the query string <FONT face=Courier>"beta catenin"<FONT 
face=Arial>, when combined with the following contents of <STRONG>Context 
</STRONG>panel</FONT></FONT>      </P>
<P><FONT face=Courier>melanoma</FONT>      </P>
<P><FONT face=Courier>cancer</FONT>      </P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>results in the query string</FONT>      </P>
<P><FONT face=Courier>("beta catenin") AND (melanoma OR 
cancer)</FONT>      </P>
<P>in this case, either the combination of "beta catenin" 
and "melanoma" or "beta catenin" and "cancer" would, when found, constitute a match. </P>
<P><FONT face=Courier></FONT>      </P>
<P>If multiple context words appear on the same line in the 
<STRONG>Context </STRONG>    panel, they will sent as is to 
the search engines.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the query string <FONT 
face=Courier>"beta-catenin"<FONT face=Arial>, when combined with the following 
contents of <STRONG>Context </STRONG>panel</FONT></FONT>      </P>
<P><FONT face=Courier>melanoma </FONT><FONT 
face=Courier>cancer</FONT>      </P>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma>results in the query string</FONT>      </P>
<P><FONT face=Courier>("beta catenin") AND melanoma 
cancer</FONT>      </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Note that the 
above query will not work in USPTO because of the multi-word term.&nbsp; We 
recommend that all multi-word context lines be either enclosed in quotes or 
separated by boolean terms, such as AND, OR, etc.&nbsp; For example, the 
<STRONG>Context </STRONG>        
           panel could 
contain</FONT>      </P>
<P><FONT face=Courier>melanoma AND cancer</FONT>      </P>
<P>resulting in the query string      </P>
<P><FONT face=Courier>("beta catenin") AND melanoma AND 
cancer</FONT>      </P>
<P>You can also manually edit the query lines in the <STRONG>Query Editor 
</STRONG>to specify more advanced search 
options, such as an "author" field.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>For PubMed, you can set the <EM>author </EM>or 
<EM>journal title </EM>fields in the query as 
<STRONG>Context.&nbsp;&nbsp;</STRONG>For example,</P>
<P>nature [ta]</P>
<P>specifies that the journal title should&nbsp;contain the 
text "nature".&nbsp; For&nbsp;further examples, please consult</P>

<H3>     Search </H3>
<P>The Search consists of the combination of all query 
strings in the <STRONG>Query Editor.&nbsp; </STRONG>When you 
press the <IMG height=16 hspace=0 src="../Images/VCRPlay.gif" width=16 
border=0>&nbsp;<STRONG>Fetch </STRONG>button, the set of queries in the <STRONG>Query Editor 
</STRONG>is submitted to multiple user-selected search engines.&nbsp; The 
retrieved results (documents) are fetched from their respective sources and each 
document is then parsed into sentences and analyzed for concept associations 
(e.g. protein-protein associations). <EM>Agilent Literature Search</EM> uses a 
set of&nbsp;<EM><A href="Working_with_Lexicons.htm">lexicons</A></EM> for 
defining concept names (and aliases) and association terms (verbs) of interest. 
The <EM><A href="Concept_Lexicon.htm">concept lexicon</A> </EM>supplied with 
this version of <EM>Agilent Literature Search </EM>contains gene/protein names 
and aliases.&nbsp; An association is extracted for every sentence containing at 
least two concept names and one verb.&nbsp; Associations&nbsp;&nbsp;are then 
converted into <EM>interactions</EM>, which are further grouped into a network. 
The sentences and source hyperlinks for each association are further stored as 
attributes of the corresponding <EM>interactions</EM> .<EM><FONT color=#ff0000></FONT></EM>      </P>
