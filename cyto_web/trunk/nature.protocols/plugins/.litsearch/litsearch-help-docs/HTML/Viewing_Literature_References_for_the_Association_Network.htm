<H1>Viewing Literature References for the Association Network</H1>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When a literature search completes, the <STRONG>Query Matches </STRONG>panel will contain entries&nbsp;that 
correspond to the retrieved results 
from the various search engines.&nbsp; These entries contain useful 
information about the source document for which the match was found, depending 
upon the search engine used.&nbsp; For example, entries for matches in 
PubMed may display title, authors, journal or publication type&nbsp;of the document, first sentence 
in 
abstract, and a URL for the document (see figure 
below).</P>
<P><IMG  hspace=0 src="../Images/litsearchQueryResult.png"  
border=0></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For those documents that specifically have mapped sentences to Cytoscape 
<EM>Node </EM>and <EM>Edges, </EM>you can highlight those <EM>Nodes </EM>and 
<EM>Edges</EM> in the 
Cytoscape window by clicking on the 
<IMG src="../Images/cytoscapeIconQueryMatches.jpg">
icon next to the entry.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can bring up the context menu on a on an 
entry in the <STRONG>Query Matches </STRONG>panel (e.g. by right-clicking in 
Windows systems) and selecting the <STRONG>Highlight Match </STRONG>menu 
item.&nbsp; Note that for documents that do not specifically have mappings to 
Cytoscape <EM>Node </EM>and <EM>Edges, </EM>the 
<IMG src="../Images/cytoscapeIconQueryMatches.jpg">
will not be displayed and 
the <STRONG>Highlight Match 
</STRONG>menu item will not 
appear on the context menu.&nbsp; A <STRONG>Refresh </STRONG>button provide in 
the <STRONG>Query Matches</STRONG>&nbsp;panel synchronizes the 
<IMG src="../Images/cytoscapeIconQueryMatches.jpg"> in 
the <STRONG>Query Matches </STRONG>entries based upon the current network being viewed.&nbsp;</P>
<P>
For any <em>Node</em> in the 
Cytoscape network diagram and for any <em>Edge</em>    between
<em>Nodes</em>, you can access the sentences and abstracts 
in the scientific literature that were utilized by <EM>Agilent Literature Search 
</EM> in generating the association network
related to that <em>Node</em> or <em>Edge</em>.&nbsp;There are two ways&nbsp;do this.&nbsp; The 
first way is to </P>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <DIV>bring up the context menu on a <EM>Node </EM>or <EM>Edge </EM>in the 
  <EM>Network </EM>(e.g. by right-clicking in Windows systems).</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV>select the <STRONG>Evidence from Literature 
  -&gt;</STRONG>  <STRONG> 
   Show Sentences from&nbsp;the Literature </STRONG>menu 
  item.</DIV></LI></OL>
  <P>This is illustrated in the figure 
  below.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../Images/contextMenuShowSentences.png" 
border=0></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The second way to view literature references is to:&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<OL>
  <LI>
    select either a <em>Node</em> or an <EM>Edge </EM>in 
  the <EM>Network</EM>. 
  <LI>On the <STRONG>Select </STRONG>menu, select the <STRONG>Evidence from Literature -&gt;</STRONG> 
  <STRONG>Show Sentences from&nbsp;the Literature </STRONG>menu item</LI></OL>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For either of these methods, a list of sentences will appear, as in the 
figure below, which displays sentences that were extracted from the earlier 
search related to melanoma. <EM>Concept lexicon</EM> terms identified in each sentence
are shown in <b>bold</b>. If an alias matched, then the formal name is shown  
<b>[formal name]</b>. Multiple Nodes and Edges can be selected at once to 
visualize all the sentences that were used by the Agilent Literature Search plugin 
to create the association Edges for the selected Nodes and Edges.
