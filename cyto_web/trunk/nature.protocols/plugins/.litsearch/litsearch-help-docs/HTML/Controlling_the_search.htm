<H1>Controlling the search</H1>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the center of the <EM>Agilent Literature Search </EM>display, there is a 
set of control panels which enable you to modify the parameters of the 
search.</P>
<P><IMG src="../Images/litsearch_query_controls.png"  border=0></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The following controls are available to you for 
modifying the parameters of the search:</P>
<H3>Search Controls</H3>
<P><IMG hspace=0 
src="../Images/searchControls.png" border=0></P>
<P><STRONG>Max Engine Matches: </STRONG>sets the maximum number of "hits" 
per query string per search engine used.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Use Aliases: </STRONG>augment the query to 
include aliases for the terms in the "<STRONG><A href="Entering_search_terms.htm">Terms</A></STRONG>" subpanel, using 
the species selected in the <STRONG>Concept Lexicon </STRONG>control.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have 
checked the <STRONG>Use Aliases </STRONG>control under <STRONG>Query 
Controls</STRONG>, then any aliases for a term (for the selected 
<STRONG>Concept Lexicon</STRONG>) will be incorporated into the query string.&nbsp; 
Aliases are incorporated in a disjunctive (OR) manner: search engine(s) will 
look to match ANY of the aliases.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Use Context: </STRONG>toggle between using and not using <STRONG><A 
href="Entering_context.htm">Context</A> </STRONG> in 
the search.&nbsp; As you enter concepts into the <STRONG>Context 
</STRONG>panel,&nbsp;if you have&nbsp;&nbsp;checked the <STRONG>Use Context 
</STRONG>control under <STRONG>Query Controls, </STRONG>then any concepts you 
have entered will be incorporated into the query string&nbsp;being&nbsp;built up 
in the <STRONG>Query Editor </STRONG>panel&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiple 
lines of&nbsp;<STRONG>context</STRONG>&nbsp;words are incorporated in a 
disjunctive (OR) manner and are combined with <STRONG>Terms </STRONG>      
in a conjunctive (AND) manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Search engine(s) will look to match ANY 
of the context AND any term (or one of its aliases) 
in the query.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3>Extraction Controls</H3>
<P><IMG 
src="../Images/extractionControls.png" border=0></P>
<P><STRONG>Concept Lexicon: </STRONG>sets the concepts used for the search.  This is for the purpose of 
creating aliases for terms of interest.  It is also used in the extraction process, in determining the 
lexicon to be used when parsing and analyzing retrieved documents.   Note that <A 
href="Concept_Lexicon.htm"><em>Concept Lexicon</em></A> is 
used for aliasing and extraction, but it is not used by the search engines to restrict query results to 
concepts in that <A 
href="Concept_Lexicon.htm"><em>Concept Lexicon</em></A>.  In the current release, most of the concept lexicons are species 
related. In order to restrict queries to a particular species, you can add an organism name in the Context
panel and this will result in the search engines constraining query results to that organism. 
<P><STRONG>Interaction Lexicon: </STRONG>sets the level of stringency used by 
the <EM>Agilent Literature Search </EM> when generating putative 
interactions from sentences of interest.&nbsp; Three options are specified in the current release: <EM>limited 
</EM>; <EM>relaxed</EM>; or <EM>empty</EM>. <A 
href="Interaction_Lexicon.htm"><EM>Interaction Lexicon</EM></A><FONT color=#ff0000><EM>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</EM><FONT 
color=#000000>is to be used when extracting "interesting sentences" from 
retrieved documents.</FONT>
