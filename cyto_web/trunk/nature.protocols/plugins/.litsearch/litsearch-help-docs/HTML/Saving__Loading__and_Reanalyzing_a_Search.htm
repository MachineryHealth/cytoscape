<H1>Saving, Loading, and Reanalyzing a Search</H1>
<P>  Upon completion of a search, all the results can be saved usingthe File-&gt;Save Search Results Menu. Search results are saved in an XML file, which can be loaded back in using theFile-&gt;Load Search Results Menu. A couple of helper files may also be saved (with the same file name but different extensions - .alfa and .acf). While these files are not explicitly saved or loaded via the menu item, any user modifications to these may break the Load feature. A search that is paused, may also be saved as defined above. The file when loaded back will allow the user to continue the paused search.
<p>
The save feature allows the user to Reanalyze the search with different Concept and Interaction Lexicons. A user may Edit the Concept or Interaction Lexicon (see Working with Lexicons) and hit the <strong>Reanalyze</strong> button. Reanalyze provides the user with quicker analysis of saved articles as the lengthy process of querying PubMed is avoided.
