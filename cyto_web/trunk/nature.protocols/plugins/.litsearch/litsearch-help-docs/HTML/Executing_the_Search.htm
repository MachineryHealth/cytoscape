<H1>Executing the Search</H1>
<P> A search can be launched and execution controlled by the use of a set 
of control buttons, which operate much in the manner of media control buttons, 
as in Windows&nbsp;Media Player(tm), or RealPlayer(tm).&nbsp; The figure below shows the 
control buttons, as they would appear immediately after execution of a 
search.</P>
<P><IMG hspace=0 src="../Images/litsearch_overview_buttons.png" border=0></P>
<P>When you press the <STRONG>Fetch </STRONG>   &nbsp; <IMG height=16 hspace=0 src="../Images/VCRPlay.gif" 
width=16 border=0>&nbsp;button, 
the set of queries in the <STRONG>Query Editor </STRONG>is submitted to multiple 
user-selected search engines.&nbsp; The retrieved results (documents) are 
fetched from their respective sources and each document is then parsed into 
sentences and analyzed for concept associations (e.g. protein-protein 
associations). <EM>Agilent Literature Search</EM> uses a set of&nbsp;<EM><A 
href="Working_with_Lexicons.htm">lexicons</A></EM> for defining concept names 
(and aliases) and association terms (verbs) of interest. The <EM><A 
href="Concept_Lexicon.htm">concept lexicon</A> </EM>supplied with this version 
of <EM>Agilent Literature Search </EM>contains gene/protein names and 
aliases.&nbsp; An association is extracted for every sentence containing at 
least two concept names and one verb.&nbsp; Associations&nbsp;&nbsp;are then 
converted into <EM>interactions</EM>, which are further grouped into a network. 
The sentences and source hyperlinks for each association are further stored as 
attributes of the corresponding <EM>interactions</EM> .<EM><FONT 
color=#ff0000></FONT></EM>  </P>
<P>At any point in the search operation, you can <STRONG>Abort </STRONG>the 
operation by pressing the <IMG height=16 hspace=0 src="../Images/VCRStop.gif" 
width=16 border=0>&nbsp;button.&nbsp; This terminates the 
source with no possibility of recovery.</P>
<P>Once the documents are fetched from their respective sources, you have the 
additional option to <STRONG>Pause</STRONG> the operation while document parsing 
and analysis is underway.&nbsp; You will see a <STRONG>Pause </STRONG>button 
<IMG height=16 hspace=0 src="../Images/VCRPause.gif" width=16 border=0>, in the 
place where the <STRONG>Fetch </STRONG>button was displayed.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you 
press this button, <EM>Agilent Literature Search </EM>interrupts the search in 
progress, with the possibility to <STRONG>Continue </STRONG>.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you then press the <STRONG>Continue </STRONG>button <IMG height=16 
hspace=0 src="../Images/VCRPlay.gif" width=16 border=0>, then <EM>Agilent 
Literature Search </EM>      
      resumes execution.</P>
<P>When you are finished with a search operation, the contents of the 
<STRONG>Terms</STRONG>, <STRONG>Context</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Query Editor 
</STRONG>panels remain intact.&nbsp; You can edit them for subsequent refined 
searches or modified searches.&nbsp; Or you can clear the contents of the 
<STRONG>Terms</STRONG>, <STRONG>Context</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Query Editor 
</STRONG>panels by pressing the <STRONG>Clear <IMG height=16 hspace=0 
src="../Images/clear.gif" width=16 border=0>&nbsp;</STRONG> button.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The <STRONG>Clear </STRONG>button can also be used to clear the contents of the 
<STRONG>Terms</STRONG>, <STRONG>Context</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Query Editor 
</STRONG>panels while you are building up your query strings prior to your 
initial search.</P>

control buttons.</P>
