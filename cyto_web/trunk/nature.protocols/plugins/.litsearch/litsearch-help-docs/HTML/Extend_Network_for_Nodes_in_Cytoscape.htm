<H1>Extend Network for Nodes in Cytoscape</H1>
<P>&nbsp;</P>You can gather fresh evidence for selected Nodes in a <EM>Network</EM> from the 
scientific literature. There are two ways do this. The first way is to 
<OL>
<li> bring up the context menu on a <EM>Node</EM> in the <EM>Network</EM> (e.g. by right-clicking in
Windows	systems). 
<li> select the <STRONG>Evidence from 
  Literature-&gt;Extend Network from the Literature</STRONG> menu item.</li></OL>
<P>This is illustrated in the figure below. </P>

<P>
The second way to view literature references is   
to:
<ol>
<li>select either a <EM>Node</EM> in the 
<EM>Network</EM>
<li>On the <STRONG>Select </STRONG>menu, select the 
  <STRONG>Evidence from Literature-&gt; Extend Network from the 
  Literature</STRONG> menu item.</li>              

</ol>
<p>

<p>
For either of these methods, a list of query terms (one 
for each selected <EM>Node</EM>) will 
be sent to Pubmed, up to 10 abstracts (you can vary the number of abstracts fetched
for each query by changing the <EM>Max Engine Matches:</EM> entry in the 
<EM>Search Controls</EM> window
of the plugin GUI) fetched for each query, and any 
associations impinging among one of the selected <EM>Nodes</EM> will be 
added along with its evidence to the <EM>Network</EM>. By default the 
<STRONG>canonicalName</STRONG> attribute is used to identify the gene 
symbol.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<P>You can select a different attribute by editing the preferences (via 
<STRONG>Edit-&gt;Preferences…),</STRONG> and changing the attribute name 
associated with the <STRONG>litSearchEvidenceAttributeName</STRONG> entry. 
If the attribute doesn't exist, you may create a new attribute. Please note 
that the attribute name is case sensitive.
