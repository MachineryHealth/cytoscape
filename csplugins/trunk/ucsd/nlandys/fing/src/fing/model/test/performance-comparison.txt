ADJACENT EDGES TEST:

  Testing:
    RootGraph.getAdjacentEdgeIndicesArray(int, boolean, boolean, boolean)

  Description of test:
    This test creates N nodes and E edges (an even mix of directed and
    undirected) in a RootGraph.  The topology of RootGraph created is
    defined by [random] bytes read from standard input.  For every node
    in the RootGraph, getAdjacentEdgeIndicesArray() is called on that
    node.  Because getAdjacentEdgeIndicesArray() takes three boolean
    input parameters defining which adjacent edges we're looking for,
    this test over all nodes should be repeated eight times, each time
    with a different set of boolean input parameters.  However, four of
    these boolean combinations cause the Luna implementation of
    RootGraph to throw NullPointerException in getAdjacentEdges().
    Therefore, this test is only repeated 4 times, each with a different
    set of boolean inputs:
      iteration 1: getAdjacentEdgeIndicesArray(int, true, true, true)
      iteration 2: getAdjacentEdgeIndicesArray(int, true, false, true)
      iteration 3: getAdjacentEdgeIndicesArray(int, false, false, false)
      iteration 4: getAdjacentEdgeIndicesArray(int, false, false, false)
