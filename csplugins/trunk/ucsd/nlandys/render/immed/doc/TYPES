This file defines visual options for nodes and edges.

NODES
=====

I. ``Shape'' is one of the following types:
  a. DIAMOND
  b. ELLIPSE
  c. HEXAGON
  d. OCTAGON
  e. PARALLELOGRAM
  f. RECTANGLE
  g. TRIANGLE

  All of the shapes can be defined as a sequence of connected line
  segments except for ELLIPSE.

  In low detail view, defaults to RECTANGLE.

II. ``Width''

  A non-negative 64 bit floating point quantity which defines the difference
  in extents of the node (modulo border thickness) along X axis, in canvas
  coordinates.

III. ``Height''

  A non-negative 64 bit floating point quantity which defines the difference
  in extents of the node (module border thickness) along Y axis, in canvas
  coordinates.

IV. ``X Position''

  In canvas coordinates, a 64 bit floating point quantity representing the
  x-coordinate of where the center of node is to be placed.

V. ``Y Position''

  In canvas coordinates, a 64 bit floating point quantity representing the
  y-coordinate of where the center of node is to be placed.

VI. ``Fill Color''

  The interior of the node is filled with this color.

VII. ``Border Type'' is one of the following types:

  a. NONE
  b. SOLID
  c. DASHED

  In low detail view, defaults to NONE.

VIII. ``Border Width''

  A non-negative 64 bit floating point quantity which defines the width of
  a border around the node shape.  The border width is essentially the width
  of a pencil, in canvas coordinates, that is used to draw along the border
  of the node shape.  Notice that half of the width will be inside the border
  and half of the width will be outside the border.  Actually, the pencil is
  not round in shape; it will result in pointed corners.

IX. `` Border Color''

  The color of the border stencil.
