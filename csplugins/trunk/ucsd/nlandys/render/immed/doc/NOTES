- Does not support resizing of canvas area.  Simply discard, instantiate
  new, and repaint when changing size of viewable area.

- The algorithms for computing the intersection of an edge line with
  the border of one of the endpoint nodes belong outside this package.
  The reason for this is that this package is stateless.  Plus, this
  package might be used to implement multiple semi-transparent layers
  so that certain rendering operations may be optimized.  In this case,
  an edge's two endpoints may fall in separate layers.  Each layer is
  implemented as a new instance of a class this package defines.
