<B>Abstract:</B>
The frequencies of ATG triplets in the genomes of various species have been
systematically analyzed, and the frequency of ATG triplets has found
significantly low around start codons in both procaryotic and eucaryotic
genomes. In eucaryotes, however, the frequency decrease before the start
codon is much more evident than that after the start codon. In procaryotes,
on the other hand, the ATG frequency pattern around the start codon is less
evident, and -- more importantly -- symmetric.<p>

We also computed average distances between a start codon and its nearest
upstream-located ATG triplet, and found a general tendency for the average
distances to be longer in higher organisms.<p>

<B>1.Introduction</B><p>

     The ribosomes of eucaryotes are known to scan mRNA from left to
     right(5' to 3') and to initiate translation usually at the
     first-encountered AUG triplet, although the ribosome sometimes ignores
     the first AUG and initiates translation at the next found AUG triplet,
     a phenomenon known as ``leaky scanning''.<p>

     In procaryotes, on the other hand, the ribosome binds directly to the
     Shine-Dalgarno sequence, and translation is initiated at an AUG triplet
     located several bases downstream of the sequence. If
     the AUG triplet is not in correct proximity to the Shine-Dalgarno
     sequences, it does not usually function as a start codon.<p>

     The insertion of an AUG triplet upstream of a start codon is reported
     to reduce the accuracy of the translation initiation at the proper
     start codon. Yun conducted similar experiments with S.cerevisiae, and
     reported that AUG triplets closer to the start codon have a higher
     probability of provoking improper translation initiations. These
     experimental results predict that AUG triplets near start codons are
     evolutionarily disadvantageous and thus appear less frequently due to
     negative selectional pressure.<p>

     We have systematically analyzed the frequencies of AUG triplets around
     start codons in genomes of various species, and found that the
     frequency of AUG triplets is indeed significantly low around start
     codons in both procaryotic and eucaryotic genomes. However, their
     patterns of AUG frequency are quite distinct between those two domains
     (procaryotes and eucaryotes), presumably because of the differences in
     their translation initiation mechanisms. We also computed average
     distances between a start codon and its nearest upstream-located ATG
     triplet for all genes in GenBank, and found a general tendency for the
     average distances to be longer in organisms in higher taxonomical
     groups.<p>



<B>2. Methods</B><p>

     Messenger RNA sequence data for Homo sapiens and Mus musculus were
     extracted from GenBank files of release 100.0. Sequence of Escherichia
     coli and Haemophilus influenzae were taken from E.coli Genome
     Center(University of Wisconsin-Madison) and TIGR microbial database,
     respectively.<p>

     Frequencies of AUG triplets at specific position with respect to start
     codons were calculated and plotted.<p>

Figures 1 and 2 show that, in H.sapiens and M.musculus, the frequencies of
AUG triplets in 5'UTR are significantly low, while rising sharply in the
coding region. It should be noted that AUG frequencies immediately after
start codons are also low, although AUG frequencies in 5'UTR are
significantly lower. We had similar results in other eucaryotes (data not
shown), and these tendencies of AUG frequencies appear across a variety of
species.<p>



AUG triplets near a start codon could disturb the ribosome's ability to
select the proper start codon. Since ribosomes scan mRNAs from left to right
(5' to 3'), AUGs in 5'UTR are probably more disruptive than AUGs in the
coding region, and this explains the uneven AUG frequencies between the two
sides of the start codon.<p>

Figures 3 and 4 show that, in E.coli and H.influenzae, the AUG frequency
decrease around the start codon is not as evident as in eucaryotes, and
their decreasing patterns are notably symmetrical. These distinct features
in eucaryotes and procaryotes are due presumably to the difference of their
translation initiation mechanisms. While the eucaryotic ribosome searches
for the start codon by scanning the mRNA from left to right (5' to 3'), the
bacterial ribosome is believed to find the start codon at once upon
recognizing the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, located several bases upstream of
the start codon. Thus, AUG triplets at either side of the start codon could
exert an equally disruptive effect on the translation initiation, resulting
the symmetric decreases of AUG triplets shown in figures 3 and 4. Also, the
bacterial ribosome is probably less sensitive to spurious AUGs around start
codons than eucaryotes, because bacterial translation initiation mechanisms,
in general, do not have to scan long lengths of mRNA.<p>

Figure 5 shows average distances between a start codon and its nearest ATG
triplet located upstream and downstream, respectively. Interestingly, the
average distances are generally longer in higher organisms and shorter in
lower organisms, as seen in the following order: primates > rodents > other
mammals > other vertebrates > invertebrates > bacteria. This rule holds only
for upstream ATG triplets but not for downstream ATGs. Higher organisms may
have more sophisticated translation initiation machinery and may be more
sensitive to spurious AUGs before start codons.<p>
