<p>

Two major signals on mRNA for translation initiation in <I>E.coli</I> are
known, i.e. start codon, and Shine-Dalgarno sequence.
<I>E.coli</I> has several kinds of start codons, i.e. AUG, GUG, and
UUG.
However, when start codons are GUG or UUG, translational efficiency is
much less. In this case, strong Shine-Dalgarno sequence may restore the
translational efficiency.

By using unbiased start codons in the whole genome of <I>E.coli</I>, we 
have conducted the computational analysis of translation initiation
sites to investigate whether Shine-Dalgarno sequences will be strong
in case where the start codons are GTG. We have applied information
theory for the accurate analysis. According to our
results, there are many GTG start sequences with weak Shine-Dalgarno
sequences. <p>

Value of (B,L) in matrix Riw is calculated by the following formula.

By applying each sequence <I>j</I> to this matrix with the following
formula, we obtain individual information Ri(<I>j</I>) according to the
model of that matrix. <p>

where s(B,L,<I>j</I>) = 1 if and only if there is base B at position L 
in the sequence <I>j</I>, otherwise s(B,L,<I>j</I>) = 0.
