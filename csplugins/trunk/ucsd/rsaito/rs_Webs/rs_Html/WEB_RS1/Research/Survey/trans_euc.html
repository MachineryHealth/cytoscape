<H1>Translation Initiation Process in Eucaryotes</H1>

<hr>

In eucaryotes, ribosome binds to the 5' CAP structure of mRNA. And
then it scans mRNA to find start codon. Usually ribosome initiate
translation at the first encountered AUG triplet. <p>

 However, the first AUG
is sometimes skipped and translation is initiated at the second or
third AUG triplet located downstream. This phenomenon is called 
leaky scanning. The leaky scanning is known to occur
more frequently in the following cases:

<OL>

<LI><B> Nucleotides around AUG are far from the optimal
context.</B> In vertebrates, for example, the optimal context for
proper translation initiation is gccGCC[AG]CC<B>AUG</B>G.  
If an AUG triplet is surrounded by a sequence very
different from the optimal context, the leaky scanning is likely to
occur; the positions -3 (purine) and +4 (guanine) are particularly
important.

<LI><B>Another AUG triplet is located closely after AUG.</B>Various
laboratory experiments.
demonstrated that insertion of another AUG after a start codon often
triggers leaky scanning.  
Our earlier study
demonstrated that AUG triplets around start codons have been
negatively selected, presumably because there has been an evolutionary
pressure to avoid leaky scanning.

<LI><B>A stop codon in the same reading frame is located closely
after AUG.</B> Kozak reported that insertion of
a stop codon in the same reading frame also triggers leaky scanning.

<LI><B> AUG is too close to CAP structure.</B>  Kozak also found that
AUG triplets located very close to the 5' terminus of mRNA are likely
to be a subject to leaky scanning.
