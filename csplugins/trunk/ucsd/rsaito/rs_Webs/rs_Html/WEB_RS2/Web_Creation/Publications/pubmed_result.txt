TI  - Variation in the Correlation of G + C Composition with Synonymous Codon Usage
      Bias among Bacteria.
PG  - 61374
AB  - G + C composition at the third codon position (GC3) is widely reported to be
      correlated with synonymous codon usage bias. However, no quantitative attempt has
      been made to compare the extent of this correlation among different genomes.
      Here, we applied Shannon entropy from information theory to measure the degree of
      GC3 bias and that of synonymous codon usage bias of each gene. The strength of
      the correlation of GC3 with synonymous codon usage bias, quantified by a
      correlation coefficient, varied widely among bacterial genomes, ranging from
      -0.07 to 0.95. Previous analyses suggesting that the relationship between GC3 and
      synonymous codon usage bias is independent of species are thus inconsistent with 
      the more detailed analyses obtained here for individual species.

TI  - Comparative expression analysis uncovers novel features of endogenous antisense
      transcription.
AB  - Increasing numbers of sense-antisense transcripts (SATs), which are transcribed
      from the same chromosomal location but in opposite directions, have been
      identified in various eukaryotic species, but the biological meanings of most
      SATs remain unclear. To improve understanding of natural sense-antisense
      transcription, we performed comparative expression profiling of SATs conserved
      among humans and mice. Using custom oligo-arrays loaded with probes that
      represented SATs with both protein-coding and non-protein-coding transcripts, we 
      showed that 33% of the 291 conserved SATs displayed identical expression patterns
      in the two species. Among these SATs, expressional balance inversion of
      sense-antisense genes was mostly observed in testis at a tissue-specific manner. 
      Northern analyses of the individual conserved SAT loci revealed that: (1) a
      smeary hybridization pattern was present in mice, but not in humans, and (2)
      small RNAs (about 60 to 80 nt) were detected from the exon-overlapping regions of
      SAT loci. In addition, further analyses showed marked alteration of
      sense-antisense expression balance throughout spermatogenesis in testis. These
      results suggest that conserved SAT loci are rich in potential regulatory roles
      that will help us understand this new class of transcripts underlying the
      mammalian genome.

TI  - Bioinformatic analysis of post-transcriptional regulation by uORF in human and
      mouse.
PG  - 4184-8
AB  - RNA decay is thought to exert an important influence on gene expression by
      maintaining a steady-state level of transcripts and/or by eliminating aberrant
      transcripts. However, the sequence elements which control such processes have not
      been determined. Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the transcripts of
      several genes are reported to control translational initiation by stalling
      ribosomes and thereby promote RNA decay. We therefore performed bioinformatic
      analysis of the tissue-wide expression profiles and mRNA half-life of transcripts
      containing uORFs in humans and mice to assess the relationship between RNA decay 
      and the presence of uORFs in transcripts. The expression levels of transcripts
      containing uORF were markedly lower than those not containing uORF. Moreover, the
      half-life of the uORF-containing transcripts was also shorter. These results
      suggest that uORFs are sequence elements that down-regulate RNA transcripts via
      RNA decay mechanisms.

AB  - Analysis and visualization of biological networks, such as protein-protein and
      protein-DNA interactions, are crucially important toward obtaining a thorough
      understanding of living systems. Here, we present an integrative software
      platform, eXpanda, which enables an analysis of a very broad range of biological 
      networks, with a special focus on the extraction of characteristic topologies
      which potentially function as units in the networks. eXpanda is provided as a
      Perl library which gives full-automatic connections to various biological
      databases via a Perl programmable interface and can perform topological analysis 
      based on graph theory. The results of these analyses are visualizable by vector
      graphics. eXpanda is under GNU General Public License. Software package, detailed
      documentations, source codes, and some sample scripts are downloadable at

TI  - Comparative analysis of cis-encoded antisense RNAs in eukaryotes.
PG  - 134-41
AB  - Recent large-scale transcriptomic analyses have identified numerous endogenously 
      encoded cis-antisense RNAs that are thought to play important roles in diverse
      cellular processes although comprehensive comparative studies among multiple
      species have yet to be performed. To investigate conserved genomic features
      across various species that may be related to sense-antisense regulation, we
      performed comparative analysis of approximately 1000-2000 cis-encoded antisense
      RNA pairs from five model eukaryotes (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila
      melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Oryza sativa). Analysis of overlapping
      patterns relative to the exon-intron structure revealed that the number of pairs 
      sharing the 3' part of the transcripts was larger than that of the 5'-sharing
      pairs except in rice. Moreover, most of the well-conserved sense-antisense pairs 
      between human and mouse exhibited 3'-overlaps, suggesting that regulatory
      mechanisms involving these regions may be important in sense-antisense
      transcription. Functional classification using Gene Ontology revealed that genes 
      related to catalytic activity, nucleotide binding, DNA metabolism, and
      mitochondria were preferentially distributed within the set of exon-overlapping
      sense-antisense genes compared to the non-exon-overlapping group in animals.
      Despite the numerous sense-antisense pairs identified in human and mouse
      individually, the number of conserved pairs was extremely small (6.6% of the
      entire set). Whereas both genes of most of the conserved sense-antisense pairs
      had protein-coding potential, nearly half of the non-conserved pairs included a
      non-coding RNA, suggesting that non-coding sense-antisense RNAs may function in
      species-specific regulatory pathways.

TI  - Noise-reduction filtering for accurate detection of replication termini in
      bacterial genomes.
PG  - 253-8
AB  - Bacterial chromosomes are highly polarized in their nucleotide composition
      through mutational selection related to replication. Using compositional skews
      such as the GC skew, replication origin and terminus can be predicted in silico
      by observing the shift points. However, the genome sequence is affected by myriad
      functional requirements and selection on numerous subgenomic features, and
      elimination of this "noise" should lead to better predictions. Here, we present a
      noise-reduction approach that uses low-pass filtering through Fast Fourier
      transform coupled with cumulative skew graphs. It increases the prediction
      accuracy of the replication termini compared with previously documented methods
      based on genomic base composition.

TI  - Inferring rules of Escherichia coli translational efficiency using an artificial 
      neural network.
PG  - 414-20
AB  - Although the machinery for translation initiation in Escherichia coli is very
      complicated, the translational efficiency has been reported to be predictable
      from upstream oligonucleotide sequences. Conventional models have difficulties in
      their generalization ability and prediction nonlinearity and in their ability to 
      deal with a variety of input attributions. To address these issues, we employed
      structural learning by artificial neural networks to infer general rules for
      translational efficiency. The correlation between translational activities
      measured by biological experiments and those predicted by our method in the test 
      data was significant (r=0.78), and our method uncovered underlying rules of
      translational activities and sequence patterns from the obtained skeleton
      structure. The significant rules for predicting translational efficiency were (1)
      G- and A-rich oligonucleotide sequences, resembling the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, 
      at positions -10 to -7; (2) first base A in the initiation codon; (3)
      transport/binding or amino acid metabolism gene function; (4) high binding energy
      between mRNA and 16S rRNA at positions -15 to -5. An additional inferred novel
      rule was that C at position -1 increases translational efficiency. When our model
      was applied to the entire genomic sequence of E. coli, translational activities
      of genes for metabolism and translational were significantly high.

AB  - Translational initiation signals, such as Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences in
      bacteria and Kozak consensus sequences in vertebrates, direct ribosomes to
      initiate protein synthesis from mRNAs. Investigating sequence characteristics of 
      these signals is important, particularly to infer translational initiation
      mechanisms. Although various statistical analyses of translational initiation
      signals have been done, few have focused on base correlations that assess base
      dependencies in the signal sequences. We used relative entropy and mutual
      information to analyze base conservation and correlation, respectively, in the 5'
      UTRs of various species. In eukaryotes, we found peaks of relative entropy at -3 
      from the translational start site but no peak of mutual information at that
      position, indicating that the base at that position (known as the core base of
      the Kozak sequence) is well conserved but not correlated with neighboring bases
      and thus functions as a single base. We observed unexpected peaks of mutual
      information between positions -2 and -1 in most eukaryotes. Surprisingly these
      base correlation also occurred in some bacteria and archaea, although there were 
      no base preferences at neither position. Various dinucleotide patterns existed at
      these positions, and the correlation between bases at -2 and -1 may be relevant
      to the context of translational initiation. Because dinucleotide patterns of
      correlated pairs of nucleotides at -2 and -1 were not unique within respective
      organisms, the correlation could not be found when analyzing single-nucleotide
      conservation. Therefore, mutual information allowed us to discover signals that
      were not found by simply analyzing base conservation.

TI  - Prediction of non-coding and antisense RNA genes in Escherichia coli with Gapped 
      Markov Model.
PG  - 171-81
AB  - A new mathematical index was developed to identify and characterize non-coding
      RNA (ncRNA) genes encoded within the Escherichia coli (E. coli) genome. It was
      designated the GMMI (Gapped Markov Model Index) and used to evaluate sequence
      patterns located at the separate positions of consensus sequences, codon biases
      and/or possible RNA structures on the basis of the Markov model. The GMMI was
      able to separate a set of known mRNA sequences from a mixture of ncRNAs including
      tRNAs and rRNAs. Consequently, the GMMI was employed to predict novel ncRNA
      candidates. At the beginning, possible transcription units were extracted from
      the E. coli genome using consensus sequences for the sigma70 promoter and the
      rho-independent terminator. Then, these units were evaluated by using the GMMI.
      This identified 133 candidate ncRNAs, which contain 29 previously annotated small
      RNA genes and 46 possible antisense ncRNAs. Furthermore 12 transcripts (including
      five antisense RNAs) were confirmed according to the expression analysis. These
      data suggests that the expression of small antisense RNAs might be more common
      than previously thought in the E. coli genome.

TI  - Computational analysis of microRNA targets in Caenorhabditis elegans.
PG  - 2-10
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous approximately 22-nucleotide (nt) non-coding
      RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of target genes via
      hybridization to target mRNA. Using known pairs of miRNA and target mRNA in
      Caenorhabditis elegans, we first performed computational analysis for specific
      hybridization patterns between these two RNAs. We counted the numbers of
      perfectly complementary dinucleotide sequences and calculated the free energy
      within complementary base pairs of each dinucleotide, observed by sliding a 2-nt 
      window along all nucleotides of the miRNA-mRNA duplex. We confirmed not only
      strong base pairing within the 5' region of miRNAs (nts 1-8) in C. elegans, but
      also the required mismatch within the central region (nt 9 or nt 10), and we
      found weak binding within the 3' region (nts 13-14). We also predicted 687
      possible miRNA target transcripts, many of which are thought to be involved in C.
      elegans development, by combining the above mentioned hybridization tendency with
      the following analyses: (1) prediction of the miRNA-mRNA duplex with free-energy 
      minimization; (2) identification of the complementary pattern within the
      miRNA-mRNA duplex; (3) conservation of target sites between C. elegans and C.
      briggsae, a related soil nematode; and (4) extraction of mRNA candidates with
      multiple target sites. Rigorous tests using shuffled miRNA controls supported
      these predictions. Our results suggest that miRNAs recognize their target mRNAs
      by their hybridization pattern and that many target mRNAs may be regulated
      through a combination of several specific miRNA target sites in C. elegans.

TI  - A problem in multivariate analysis of codon usage data and a possible solution.
PG  - 6499-504
AB  - Multivariate analyses are often used to identify major trends of variation in
      synonymous codon usage among genes. These analyses need to be performed on
      properly normalized codon usage data to avoid biases masking this synonymous
      variation, i.e., gene length, amino acid usage, and codon degeneracy; however,
      previous studies have failed to do so. In this paper, we demonstrate that the use
      of alternative normalized data (called 'relative adaptiveness' in the literature)
      can avoid all these biases and furthermore, can identify more trends of variation
      among genes, including GC-ending codon usage, GT-ending codon usage, and gene
      expression level.

TI  - The 'weighted sum of relative entropy': a new index for synonymous codon usage
      bias.
PG  - 19-23
AB  - Shannon entropy from information theory has been applied to estimate the degree
      of deviation from equal usage of synonymous codons; however, previous attempts
      have failed to take into account all three aspects of amino acid usage, i.e. (i) 
      the number of distinct amino acids, (ii) their relative frequencies, and (iii)
      their degree of codon degeneracy. A new index taking into account all of these
      aspects is proposed. The index, designated as the 'weighted sum of relative
      entropy' (E(w)), is defined as the sum of the relative entropy of each amino acid
      weighted by its relative frequency in the sequence. In this paper, we demonstrate
      that E(w) allows us to avoid some amino acid usage biases and can yield results
      contradictory to those obtained by previous methods.

TI  - A new role for expressed pseudogenes as ncRNA: regulation of mRNA stability of
      its homologous coding gene.
PG  - 414-22
AB  - We have earlier generated a mutant mouse in a course of making a transgenic line 
      that exhibited interesting heterozygote phenotypes, which exhibited failure to
      thrive, severe bone deformities, and polycystic kidneys. This mutant mouse
      provided a clue to uncover a unique role of expressed pseudogenes. In this mutant
      the transgene was integrated into the vicinity of the expressing pseudogene of
      Makorin1 called Makorin1-p1. This insertion reduced transcription of the
      Makorin1-p1, resulting in destabilization of the Makorin1 mRNA in trans via a
      cis-acting RNA decay element within the 5' region of Makorin1 that is homologous 
      between Makorin1 and Makorin1-p1. These findings demonstrate a novel and specific
      regulatory role of an expressed pseudogene as well as functional significance for
      noncoding RNAs. Next, we developed an original algorithm to determine how many
      pseudogenes are expressed. Based on our examination 2-3% of human processed
      pseudogenes are expressed using the most strict criteria. Interestingly, the
      mouse has a much smaller proportion of expressed pseudogenes (0.5-1%).
      Pseudogenes are functionally less constrained, and have accumulated more
      mutations than translated genes. If they have some functions in gene regulation, 
      this property would allow more rapid functional diversification than
      protein-coding genes. In addition, some genetic phenomena that exhibit incomplete
      penetrance might be attributed to "mutation" or "variation" of pseudogenes.

TI  - Comparative study of translation termination sites and release factors (RF1 and
      RF2) in procaryotes.
PG  - 665-72
AB  - Translation termination is catalyzed by release factors that recognize stop
      codons. However, previous works have shown that in some bacteria, the termination
      process also involves bases around stop codons. Recently, Ito et al. analyzed
      release factors and identified the amino acids therein that recognize stop
      codons. However, the amino acids that recognize bases around stop codons remain
      unclear. To identify the candidate amino acids that recognize the bases around
      stop codons, we aligned the protein sequences of the release factors of various
      bacteria and searched for amino acids that were conserved specifically in the
      sequence of bacteria that seemed to regulate translation termination by bases
      around stop codons. As a result, species having several highly conserved residues
      in RF1 and RF2 showed positive correlations between their codon usage bias and
      conservation of the bases around the stop codons. In addition, some of the
      residues were located very close to the SPF motif, which deciphers stop codons.
      These results suggest that these conserved amino acids enable the release factors
      to recognize the bases around the stop codons.

TI  - Computational analysis of stop codon readthrough in D.melanogaster.
PG  - 1371-80
AB  - MOTIVATION: Readthrough is an unusual process in which a stop codon is misread or
      skipped. Recently it has been shown that some translation is regulated by the
      readthrough reactions although the complete mechanism is not clear. Therefore,
      the discovery of 'readthrough genes' is important for further investigation of
      their cellular roles, which may provide additional insights into the mechanism of
      translational regulation. RESULTS: We constructed a system that lists candidates 
      of readthrough genes based on the existence of a 'protein motif' at the 3'
      untranslated region (UTR). Using this system, we extracted 85 candidates from
      4082 nucleic acid sequences of Drosophila melanogaster in GenBank database. The
      sequences of these candidates had a slightly more stable secondary structure and 
      different base preferences compared to the non-candidates. As these features are 
      known to have an effect on readthrough events, we would like to suggest that
      these candidates contain actual readthrough genes. AVAILABILITY: Source code of
      the system is available upon request.

      from Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare. Through homology searches of
      publicly available sequence data, we assigned tentative protein functions to
      21,596 clones (75.86%). Mapping of the cDNA clones to genomic DNA revealed that
      there are 19,000 to 20,500 transcription units in the rice genome. Protein
      informatics analysis against the InterPro database revealed the existence of
      proteins presented in rice but not in Arabidopsis. Sixty-four percent of our
      cDNAs are homologous to Arabidopsis proteins.

AB  - Here, we describe the development of a mammalian protein-protein interaction
      (PPI) database and of a PPI Viewer application to display protein interaction
      networks (http://fantom21.gsc.riken.go.jp/PPI/). In the database, we stored the
      mammalian PPIs identified through our PPI assays (internal PPIs), as well as
      those we extracted and processed (external PPIs) from publicly available data
      sources, the DIP and BIND databases and MEDLINE abstracts by using FACTS, a new
      functional inference and curation system. We integrated the internal and external
      PPIs into the PPI database, which is linked to the main FANTOM2 viewer. In
      addition, we incorporated into the PPI Viewer information regarding the
      luciferase reporter activity of internal PPIs and the data confidence of external
      PPIs; these data enable visualization and evaluation of the reliability of each
      interaction. Using the described system, we successfully identified several
      interactions of biological significance. Therefore, the PPI Viewer is a useful
      tool for exploring FANTOM2 clone-related protein interactions and their potential
      effects on signaling and cellular communication.

TI  - Inferring higher functional information for RIKEN mouse full-length cDNA clones
      with FACTS.
PG  - 1520-33
AB  - FACTS (Functional Association/Annotation of cDNA Clones from Text/Sequence
      Sources) is a semiautomated knowledge discovery and annotation system that
      integrates molecular function information derived from sequence analysis results 
      (sequence inferred) with functional information extracted from text.
      Text-inferred information was extracted from keyword-based retrievals of MEDLINE 
      abstracts and by matching of gene or protein names to OMIM, BIND, and DIP
      database entries. Using FACTS, we found that 47.5% of the 60,770 RIKEN mouse cDNA
      FANTOM2 clone annotations were informative for text searches. MEDLINE queries
      yielded molecular interaction-containing sentences for 23.1% of the clones. When 
      disease MeSH and GO terms were matched with retrieved abstracts, 22.7% of clones 
      were associated with potential diseases, and 32.5% with GO identifiers. A
      significant number (23.5%) of disease MeSH-associated clones were also found to
      have a hereditary disease association (OMIM Morbidmap). Inferred neoplastic and
      nervous system disease represented 49.6% and 36.0% of disease MeSH-associated
      clones, respectively. A comparison of sequence-based GO assignments with
      informative text-based GO assignments revealed that for 78.2% of clones,
      identical GO assignments were provided for that clone by either method, whereas
      for 21.8% of clones, the assignments differed. In contrast, for OMIM assignments,
      only 28.5% of clones had identical sequence-based and text-based OMIM
      assignments. Sequence, sentence, and term-based functional associations are
      included in the FACTS database (http://facts.gsc.riken.go.jp/), which permits
      results to be annotated and explored through web-accessible keyword and sequence 
      search interfaces. The FACTS database will be a critical tool for investigating
      the functional complexity of the mouse transcriptome, cDNA-inferred interactome
      (molecular interactions), and pathome (pathologies).

TI  - CDS annotation in full-length cDNA sequence.
PG  - 1478-87
AB  - The identification of coding sequences (CDS) is an important step in the
      functional annotation of genes. CDS prediction for mammalian genes from genomic
      sequence is complicated by the vast abundance of intergenic sequence in the
      genome, and provides little information about how different parts of potential
      CDS regions are expressed. In contrast, mammalian gene CDS prediction from cDNA
      sequence offers obvious advantages, yet encounters a different set of
      complexities when performed on high-throughput cDNA (HTC) sequences, such as the 
      set of 60,770 cDNAs isolated from full-length enriched libraries of the FANTOM2
      project. We developed a CDS annotation strategy that uses a variety of different 
      CDS prediction programs to annotate the CDS regions of FANTOM2 cDNAs. These
      include rsCDS, which uses sequence similarity to known proteins; ProCrest;
      Longest-ORF and Truncated-ORF, which are ab initio based predictors; and finally,
      DECODER and NCBI CDS predictor, which use a combination of both principles. Aided
      by graphical displays of these CDS prediction results in the context of other
      sequence similarity results for each cDNA, FANTOM2 CDS inspection by curators and
      follow-up quality control procedures resulted in high quality CDS predictions for
      a total of 14,345 FANTOM2 clones.

TI  - Identification of putative noncoding RNAs among the RIKEN mouse full-length cDNA 
      collection.
PG  - 1301-6
AB  - With the sequencing and annotation of genomes and transcriptomes of several
      eukaryotes, the importance of noncoding RNA (ncRNA)-RNA molecules that are not
      translated to protein products-has become more evident. A subclass of ncRNA
      transcripts are encoded by highly regulated, multi-exon, transcriptional units,
      are processed like typical protein-coding mRNAs and are increasingly implicated
      in regulation of many cellular functions in eukaryotes. This study describes the 
      identification of candidate functional ncRNAs from among the RIKEN mouse
      full-length cDNA collection, which contains 60,770 sequences, by using a
      systematic computational filtering approach. We initially searched for previously
      reported ncRNAs and found nine murine ncRNAs and homologs of several previously
      described nonmouse ncRNAs. Through our computational approach to filter
      artifact-free clones that lack protein coding potential, we extracted 4280
      transcripts as the largest-candidate set. Many clones in the set had EST hits,
      potential CpG islands surrounding the transcription start sites, and homologies
      with the human genome. This implies that many candidates are indeed transcribed
      in a regulated manner. Our results demonstrate that ncRNAs are a major functional
      subclass of processed transcripts in mammals.

      Cap-Trapper,and in most cases,aggressively subtracted/normalized. We have
      produced 1,442,236 successful 3'-end sequences clustered into 171,144 groups,
      from which 60,770 clones were fully sequenced cDNAs annotated in the FANTOM-2
      annotation. We have also produced 547,149 5' end reads,which clustered into
      124,258 groups. Altogether, these cDNAs were further grouped in 70,000
      transcriptional units (TU),which represent the best coverage of a transcriptome
      so far. By monitoring the extent of normalization/subtraction, we define the
      tentative equivalent coverage (TEC),which was estimated to be equivalent to
      >12,000,000 ESTs derived from standard libraries. High coverage explains
      discrepancies between the very large numbers of clusters (and TUs) of this
      project,which also include non-protein-coding RNAs,and the lower gene number
      estimation of genome annotations. Altogether,5'-end clusters identify regions
      that are potential promoters for 8637 known genes and 5'-end clusters suggest the
      presence of almost 63,000 transcriptional starting points. An estimate of the
      frequency of polyadenylation signals suggests that at least half of the
      singletons in the EST set represent real mRNAs. Clones accounting for about half 
      of the predicted TUs await further sequencing. The continued high-discovery rate 
      suggests that the task of transcriptome discovery is not yet complete.

TI  - Construction of reliable protein-protein interaction networks with a new
      interaction generality measure.
PG  - 756-63
AB  - MOTIVATION: Recent screening techniques have made large amounts of
      protein-protein interaction data available, from which biologically important
      information such as the function of uncharacterized proteins, the existence of
      novel protein complexes, and novel signal-transduction pathways can be
      discovered. However, experimental data on protein interactions contain many false
      positives, making these discoveries difficult. Therefore computational methods of
      assessing the reliability of each candidate protein-protein interaction are
      urgently needed. RESULTS: We developed a new 'interaction generality' measure
      (IG2) to assess the reliability of protein-protein interactions using only the
      topological properties of their interaction-network structure. Using yeast
      protein-protein interaction data, we showed that reliable protein-protein
      interactions had significantly lower IG2 values than less-reliable interactions, 
      suggesting that IG2 values can be used to evaluate and filter interaction data to
      enable the construction of reliable protein-protein interaction networks.

TI  - Global insights into protein complexes through integrated analysis of the
      reliable interactome and knockout lethality.
PG  - 633-40
AB  - We performed an integrated computational analysis of data derived from a
      comprehensive set of protein-protein interactions (interactome) and a phenotype
      dataset on lethality in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For the analysis, we selected
      reliable interactome data using our previous 'interaction generality,' a
      computational approach to assess reliability of interactions. Those efforts gave 
      clear evidence that proteins with lethal phenotypes in knockout studies (lethal
      proteins) may interact with each other to form functional protein complexes to
      perform their cellular roles. However, our analysis indicates that interactions
      between lethal proteins are rather restricted to the same cellular pathway or
      function, and it is quite unlikely that they interact with other lethal proteins 
      functioning in different cellular roles. Furthermore, our results allowed us
      predictions on the functions of thus far uncharacterized lethal proteins with an 
      estimated 93% accuracy. Thus, the analysis described in here can provide global
      insights into the biological features of the protein complexes.

TI  - On biased distribution of introns in various eukaryotes.
PG  - 89-95
AB  - We conducted comprehensive analyses on intron positions in the Mus musculus
      genome by comparing genomic sequences in the GenBank database and cDNA sequences 
      in the mouse cDNA library recently developed by Riken Genomic Sciences Center.
      Our results confirm that introns have a tendency to be located toward the 5' end 
      of the gene. The same type of analysis was conducted in the coding region of
      seven eukaryotes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Plasmodium falciparum, Caenorhabditis
      elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, M. musculus, Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis
      thaliana). Introns in genes with a single intron have a locational bias toward
      the 5' end in all species except A. thaliana. We also measured the distance from 
      the start codon to the position of the intron, and found that single introns
      prefer the location immediately after the start codon in S. cerevisiae and P.
      falciparum. We discuss three possible explanations for these findings: (1) they
      are the consequence of intron loss by reverse-transcriptase; (2) they are
      necessary to accommodate the function; and (3) they are concerned with the
      mechanism of pre-mRNA splicing.

PG  - 79-87
AB  - Recent investigations into the translation termination sites of various organisms
      have revealed that not only stop codons but also sequences around stop codons
      have an effect on translation termination. To investigate the relationship
      between these sequence patterns and translation as well as its termination
      efficiency, we analysed the correlation between strength of consensus and
      translation efficiency, as predicted according to Codon Adaptation Index (CAI)
      value. We used RIKEN full-length mouse cDNA sequences and ten other eukaryotic
      UniGene datasets from NCBI for the analyses. First, we conducted sequence profile
      analyses following translation termination sites. We found base G and A at
      position +1 as a strong consensus for mouse cDNA. A similar consensus was found
      for other mammals, such as Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus and Bos taurus.
      However, some plants had different consensus sequences. We then analysed the
      correlation between the strength of consensus at each position and the codon
      biases of whole coding regions, using information content and CAI value. The
      results showed that in mouse cDNA, CAI value had a positive correlation with
      information content at positions +1. We also found that, for positions with
      strong consensus, the strength of the consensus is likely to have a positive
      correlation with CAI value in some other eukaryotes. Along with these
      observations, biological insights into the relationship between gene expression
      level, codon biases and consensus sequence around stop codons will be discussed.

TI  - Analysis of the mouse transcriptome based on functional annotation of 60,770
      full-length cDNAs.
PG  - 563-73
AB  - Only a small proportion of the mouse genome is transcribed into mature messenger 
      RNA transcripts. There is an international collaborative effort to identify all
      full-length mRNA transcripts from the mouse, and to ensure that each is
      represented in a physical collection of clones. Here we report the manual
      annotation of 60,770 full-length mouse complementary DNA sequences. These are
      clustered into 33,409 'transcriptional units', contributing 90.1% of a newly
      established mouse transcriptome database. Of these transcriptional units, 4,258
      are new protein-coding and 11,665 are new non-coding messages, indicating that
      non-coding RNA is a major component of the transcriptome. 41% of all
      transcriptional units showed evidence of alternative splicing. In protein-coding 
      transcripts, 79% of splice variations altered the protein product.
      Whole-transcriptome analyses resulted in the identification of 2,431
      sense-antisense pairs. The present work, completely supported by physical clones,
      provides the most comprehensive survey of a mammalian transcriptome so far, and
      is a valuable resource for functional genomics.

AB  - Although many studies on alternative splicing of specific genes have been
      reported in the literature, the general mechanism that regulates alternative
      splicing has not been clearly understood. In this study, we systematically
      aligned each pair of the 21,076 cDNA sequences of Mus musculus, searched for
      putative alternative splicing patterns, and constructed a list of potential
      alternative splicing sites. Two cDNAs are suspected to be alternatively spliced
      and originating from a common gene if they share most of their region with a high
      degree of sequence homology, but parts of the sequences are very distinctive or
      deleted in either cDNA. The list contains the following information: (1) tissue, 
      (2) developmental stage, (3) sequences around splice sites, (4) the length of
      each gapped region, and (5) other comments. The list is available at
      http://www.bioinfo.sfc.keio.ac.jp/intron. Our results have predicted a number of 
      unreported alternatively spliced genes, some of which are expressed only in a
      specific tissue or at a specific developmental stage.

TI  - Interaction generality, a measurement to assess the reliability of a
      protein-protein interaction.
PG  - 1163-8
AB  - Here we introduce the 'interaction generality' measure, a new method for
      computationally assessing the reliability of protein-protein interactions
      obtained in biological experiments. This measure is basically the number of
      proteins involved in a given interaction and also adopts the idea that
      interactions observed in a complicated interaction network are likely to be true 
      positives. Using a group of yeast protein-protein interactions identified in
      various biological experiments, we show that interactions with low generalities
      are more likely to be reproducible in other independent assays. We constructed
      more reliable networks by eliminating interactions whose generalities were above 
      a particular threshold. The rate of interactions with common cellular roles
      increased from 63% in the unadjusted estimates to 79% in the refined networks. As
      a result, the rate of cross-talk between proteins with different cellular roles
      decreased, enabling very clear predictions of the functions of some unknown
      proteins. The results suggest that the interaction generality measure will make
      interaction data more useful in all organisms and may yield insights into the
      biological roles of the proteins studied.

TI  - T2BP, a novel TRAF2 binding protein, can activate NF-kappaB and AP-1 without TNF 
      stimulation.
PG  - 1108-13
AB  - TRAF2 is a key molecule involved in TNF signaling, which is crucial for the
      regulation of inflammatory processes. We have identified a novel TRAF2 binding
      protein, designated as T2BP (TRAF2 binding protein), by a mammalian two-hybrid
      screening approach. T2BP is a relatively small protein of 184 amino acids, which 
      includes a forkhead-associated domain, the phosphopeptide binding motif. The
      interaction domain search showed that the TRAF domain in TRAF2 is required for
      the binding to T2BP whereas almost the entire protein in T2BP binds to TRAF2. The
      interaction was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression profiling
      for T2BP and TRAF2 revealed an ubiquitous expression in adult mouse tissues.
      Overexpression of T2BP in HEK293 cells activated NF-kappaB and AP-1 in a dose
      dependent manner as well as seen in the TNF-treated control cells. Our results
      suggest that T2BP is involved in the TNF-mediated signaling by its interaction
      with TRAF2.

TI  - Protein-protein interaction panel using mouse full-length cDNAs.
PG  - 1758-65
AB  - We have developed a novel assay system for systematic analysis of protein-protein
      interactions (PPIs) that is characteristic of a PCR-mediated rapid sample
      preparation and a high-throughput assay system based on the mammalian two-hybrid 
      method. Using gene-specific primers, we successfully constructed the assay
      samples by two rounds of PCR with up to 3.6 kb from the first-round PCR
      fragments. In the assay system, we designed all the steps to be performed by
      adding only samples, reagents, and cells into 384-well assay plates using two
      types of semiautomatic multiple dispensers. The system enabled us examine more
      than 20,000 assay wells per day. We detected 145 interactions in our pilot study 
      using 3500 samples derived from mouse full-length enriched cDNAs. Analysis of the
      interaction data showed both several significant interaction clusters and
      predicted functions of a few uncharacterized proteins. In combination with our
      comprehensive mouse full-length cDNA clone bank covering a large part of the
      whole genes, our high-throughput assay system will discover many interactions to 
      facilitate understanding of the function of uncharacterized proteins and the
      molecular mechanism of crucial biological processes, and also enable completion
      of a rough draft of the entire PPI panel in certain cell types or tissues of
      mouse within a short time.

      usage bias in Mus musculus genes.
PG  - 101-5
AB  - The codon adaptation index (CAI) values of all protein-coding sequences of the
      full-length cDNA libraries of Mus musculus were computed based on the RIKEN mouse
      full-length cDNA library. We have also computed the extent of consensus in
      flanking sequences of the initiator ATG codon based on the 'relative entropy'
      values of respective nucleotide positions (from -20 to +12 bp relative to the
      initiator ATG codon) for each group of genes classified by CAI values. With
      regard to the two nucleotides positions (-3 and +4) known to be highly conserved 
      in Kozak's consensus sequence, a clear correlation between CAI values and
      relative entropy values was observed at position -3 but this was not significant 
      at position +4, although a significant correlation was found at position -1 of
      the consensus sequence. Further, although no correlation was observed at any
      additional positions, relative entropy values were very high at positions -4, -6,
      and -8 in genes with high CAI values. These findings suggest that the extent of
      conservation in the flanking sequence of the initiator ATG codon including
      Kozak's consensus sequence was an important factor in modulation of the
      translation efficiency as well as synonymous codon usage bias particularly in
      highly expressed genes.

TI  - Correlation between Shine--Dalgarno sequence conservation and codon usage of
      bacterial genes.
PG  - 164-70
AB  - In this study, we analyzed the correlation between codon usage bias and
      Shine--Dalgarno (SD) sequence conservation, using complete genome sequences of
      nine prokaryotes. For codon usage bias, we adopted the codon adaptation index
      (CAI), which is based on the codon usage preference of genes encoding ribosomal
      proteins, elongation factors, heat shock proteins, outer membrane proteins, and
      RNA polymerase subunit proteins. To compute SD sequence conservation, we used SD 
      motif sequences predicted by Tompa and systematically aligned them with 5'UTR
      sequences. We found that there exists a clear correlation between the CAI values 
      and SD sequence conservation in the genomes of Escherichia coli, Bacillus
      subtilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Methanobacterium
      thermoautotrophicum, and Methanococcus jannaschii, and no relationship is found
      in M. genitalium, M. pneumoniae, and Synechocystis. That is, genes with higher
      CAI values tend to have more conserved SD sequences than do genes with lower CAI 
      values in these organisms. Some organisms, such as M. thermoautotrophicum, do not
      clearly show the correlation. The biological significance of these results is
      discussed in the context of the translation initiation process and translation
      efficiency.

AB  - The RIKEN Mouse Gene Encyclopaedia Project, a systematic approach to determining 
      the full coding potential of the mouse genome, involves collection and sequencing
      of full-length complementary DNAs and physical mapping of the corresponding genes
      to the mouse genome. We organized an international functional annotation meeting 
      (FANTOM) to annotate the first 21,076 cDNAs to be analysed in this project. Here 
      we describe the first RIKEN clone collection, which is one of the largest
      described for any organism. Analysis of these cDNAs extends known gene families
      and identifies new ones.

TI  - Computer analysis of potential stem structures of rRNA operons in various
      procaryote genomes.
PG  - 217-22
AB  - The processing of 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA by RNase III in E.coli is known to
      involve stem structures formed by both ends of the rRNA. Indeed, complementary
      nucleotide sequences are usually found at both ends of 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA.
      However, whether or not this phenomenon exists in various other bacteria has not 
      yet been adequately studied. We have conducted computer analyses of potential
      stem structures of rRNA operons in 12 bacterial and 3 archaeal genomes, and
      compared characteristics of the stem structures among these species. We
      systematically computed free energy values by exhaustively 'annealing' sequences 
      around the 5' end and sequences around the 3' end of both 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA
      genes, in order to predict potential stem structures.The results suggest that
      rRNAs in most species form stem structures at both ends. Some species, such as
      A.aeolicus, seem to form unusually stable stem structures. On the other hand,
      some rRNAs, such as rRNAs of D.radiodurans, seem not to form solid stem
      structures. This suggests that rRNA processing in those species must employ a
      reliable targeting mechanism other than recognizing stem structures by RNase III.

AB  - We conducted comprehensive sequence analysis of 5' flanking regions of primate
      Alu elements. Information contents were computed and frequencies of 1024
      pentanucleotides were measured to approximate the location of a characteristic
      sequence and to specify its pattern(s), which may be involved in the integration 
      of Alu elements into their host genomes. A large number of samples was used, the 
      wide region of the 5' end of Alu elements was analyzed, and comparisons were made
      among different subfamilies. Through our analyses, "TTTTAAAAA" or "(T)(m)(A)(n)" 
      can be stated as a candidate for the characteristic sequence pattern, which
      resides around the region 5 to 20 base pairs upstream of the 5' end of Alu
      elements. This characteristic sequence pattern was more prominent in the
      sequences of younger Alus, which is a strong indication that the sequence pattern
      has a role at the time of Alu integration.

TI  - Comprehensive Sequence Analyses of 5' Flanking Regions of Primate Alu Elements.
PG  - 41-48
AB  - Retrotransposons have been generally known to integrate randomly into host
      genomes. Jurka (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94: 1872-1877, 1977), however, showed 
      consensus sequence patterns at integration sites of certain mammalian
      retrotransposons, and suggested involvement of sequence specific enzymes that
      mediate integration. We have conducted comprehensive sequence analyses of 5'
      flanking regions of primate Alu elements. In contrast to the small but clean data
      set Jurka (1977) used, (1) larger number of samples were used, (2) wider region
      of 5' end of Alu elements was analyzed, and (3) comparisons were made among
      different subfamilies for comprehensive analyses in order to identify
      characteristic sequence pattern(s) preceding 5' end of Alu elements. The
      nucleotide occurrences at each position within 500 bases of 5' end of Alus were
      counted to obtain profiles. Information content at each nucleotide position in
      the same region was, then, computed. Distinctive difference in the nucleotide
      composition and information content values that divides the region into two was
      observed. The region between -20 and 5' end of Alu elements is found to be highly
      adenine-rich and shows significantly higher information content values compared
      to the rest of the region, implying the existence of certain characteristic
      sequence pattern in this region. Also, younger subfamilies of Alu elements show
      higher information content values than older subfamilies. This implies that
      certain characteristic sequence pattern already existed in the region between -20
      and 5' end of Alu elements at the time of Alu integration, and accumulation of
      mutation in the course of time resulted in the less distinctive sequence pattern 
      in older sequences. Frequencies of all possible triplets (total of 64) were
      measured in the same region in order to identify characteristic sequence
      pattern(s). Observation that frequencies of triplets aaa, taa and tta in the 5'
      flanking sequences were high is consistent with Jurka (1977). Frequencies of some
      other triplets such as gaa, caa, aac, ctt, gtt, atg, etc. which do not comprise
      the primary candidates for the nick site in Jurka (1977) also show significantly 
      high frequencies.

TI  - Computer analyses of complete genomes suggest that some archaebacteria employ
      both eukaryotic and eubacterial mechanisms in translation initiation.
PG  - 79-83
AB  - The translation initiation mechanism of archaebacteria is still not clearly
      understood. Our previous work showed that ATG triplets before start codons have
      been strongly depleted in eukaryotic genomes, presumably because ribosome of
      eukaryotes scans mRNA from the 5' to 3' direction to find proper start codons.
      Extra ATG triplets before start codons would confuse the process and thus they
      have been negatively selected in eukaryotic genomes. In eubacterial genomes, on
      the other hand, ribosome binds to the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence at once
      without mRNA scanning, and the characteristic patterns of ATG triplet depletion
      were not observed (Saito, R., Tomita, M., 1999. On negative selection against ATG
      triplets near start codons in eukaryotic and procaryotic genomes. J. Mol. Evol.
      48, 213-217). The ATG triplet analysis on archaebacterial genomes revealed that
      Methanococcus jannaschii and Pyrococcus horikoshii show patterns similar to
      eukaryotes, implying that these species employ scanning of mRNA from the 5' to 3'
      direction in the process of translation initiation. On the other hand, our
      earlier study found that these archaea have SD-like sequences, which are
      complementary to the 3' end sequence of 16S rRNA, as in eubacterial translation
      initiation (Osada, Y., Saito, R., Tomita, M. Analysis of base-pairing potentials 
      between 16S rRNA and 5' UTR for translation initiation in various procaryotes.
      Bioinformatics, in press). These two results combined lead us to conclude that
      these archaea probably use a hybrid mechanism; their ribosome scans mRNAs from
      the 5' to 3' direction and then 16S rRNA binds to the SD-like sequence of the 5' 
      UTR.

TI  - Analysis of base-pairing potentials between 16S rRNA and 5' UTR for translation
      initiation in various prokaryotes.
PG  - 578-81
AB  - MOTIVATION: It is well accepted that the 3' end of 16S rRNA is directly involved 
      in prokaryotic translation initiation by pairing with the Shine-Dalgarno (SD)
      sequence, which is located in the ribosome-binding site of mRNA. According to
      Shine and Dalgarno, Escherichia coli 's 5' UTR has the pattern of 'AGGAGG' (SD
      sequence), which is complementary to the 3' end sequence of 16S rRNA. In this
      work, we systematically calculated free-energy values of the base pairing between
      the 3' end of 16S rRNA and the 5' UTR of mRNA, in order to analyze the
      base-pairing potentials in various prokaryotes. The free-energy values were then 
      plotted over distances from the start codon to visualize the free-energy pattern 
      of 5'UTRs. RESULTS: The average free-energy values fell sharply before the start 
      codon in E. coli, which is consistent with the model that the 3' end of 16S rRNA 
      base pairs with the SD sequence. Haemophilus influenzae, Bacillus subtilis and
      Helicobacter pylori show a similar pattern, suggesting that the organisms have
      basically the same mechanism of translation initiation as E. coli. Other
      eubacteria, such as Synechocystis PCC6803, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma
      pneumoniae and Borrelia burgdorferi also show decreases in their free-energy
      values, although they are less evident. We also did the same analysis with a
      eukaryote genome as a control; no fall in free-energy values was observed between
      the 3' end of 18S rRNA and 5' UTRs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that
      this organism does not base pair in translation initiation. The three
      archaebacteria A. fulgidus, M. jannaschii and M. thermoautotrophicum show
      patterns similar to eubacteria, but not to S. cerevisiae, indicating that
      archaebacteria are closer to eubacteria than to eukaryotes with respect to the
      mechanism of translation initiation. From these observations, it appears that the
      shape of the curve produced by the algorithm can be used to predict the mechanism
      of translation initiation. AVAILABILITY: The C programs used in our analysis are 
      available upon request.

TI  - Sequence patterns observed in 5' flanking regions of primate Alu elements.

AB  - Retrotransposons have generally been known to integrate randomly into host
      genomes. Jurka, however, showed some consensus sequence patterns at insertion
      sites of some mammalian retrotransposons and proposed enzymatic involvement that 
      mediates integration. Jurka used about 400 complete human Alu and rodent ID
      sequences which retain full length with identical flanking sequences at both
      ends. In our study, more than 25,000 Alu sequences longer than 250 bp were used
      for comprehensive analysis to identify any consensus sequence(s) preceding the 5'
      end of Alu elements. "Entropy" at each nucleotide position within 500 bases of
      the 5' Alu end was computed. Significant drop of entropy was observed between
      position -20 and -10 of the 5' end of Alu, suggesting the existence of certain
      consensus sequence(s) in the region. Frequencies of all possible triplets (total 
      of 64) were measured in the same region. Observation that frequencies of triplets
      "aaa," "taa," and "tta" in the 5' flanking sequences were high is consistent with
      Jurka. However, frequencies of triplets "att" and "aca" were also significantly
      high, which are not the primary candidates for nick site in Jurka.

TI  - On negative selection against ATG triplets near start codons in eukaryotic and
      prokaryotic genomes.
PG  - 213-7
AB  - The frequencies of ATG triplets in the genomes of various species were
      systematically analyzed, and the frequency of ATG triplets was significantly low 
      around start codons in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. In eukaryotes,
      however, the frequency decrease before the start codon is much more evident than 
      that after the start codon. In prokaryotes, on the other hand, the ATG frequency 
      pattern around the start codon is less evident, and-more importantly-symmetric.
      We also computed average distances between a start codon and its nearest
      upstream-located ATG triplet and found a general tendency for the average
      distances to be longer in higher organisms.
