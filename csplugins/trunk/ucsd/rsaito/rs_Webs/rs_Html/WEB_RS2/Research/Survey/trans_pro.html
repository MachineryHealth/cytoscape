<H1>Translation Initiation Process in Procaryotes</H1>

<hr>

In procaryotes, a ribosome with tRNA which carries methionine binds to 
the specific region of mRNA and recognizes AUG codon nearby
and protein synthesis begins. In this process the main factors are
ribosome, tRNA with methionine(fMet-tRNA-Metf), and mRNA. In addition, 
at least initiation factors and GTP molecule are required to ensure
the efficiency and fidelity of this process.<p>

Bacterial mRNAs are commonly polycistronic. That means that they encode
multiple proteins that are separatedly translated from the same mRNA
molecule. Sometimes coding regions overlap, but it may not effect the
fidelity of
translation. Sometimes coding regions overlap by one base, which 
will be like UG[AUG].<p>

In bacterial mRNA, ribosome binding site and start codon play important
roles for translation initiation. Ribosome binding site is where the 30S
small subunit binds first on mRNA. This site contains purine
rich sequence which is called Shine-Dalgarno sequence. 
The 3' terminal of 16S rRNA in 30S subunit binds
to this sequence and helps 30S subunit to bind to mRNA.<p>

This interaction makes a major contribution to the efficiency of initiation
and provides the bacterial cell with a simple way to regulate protein
synthesis. Many translational control mechanisms in procaryotes involve 
blocking the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, either by covering it with a bound
protein or by incorporating it into a base-paired region in the mRNA
molecule. <p>

Most <I>E.Coli</I> mRNAs have Shine-Dalgarno sequences(except mRNA for dnaG
primase).
The sequence of 3' terminal of 16S rRNA in <I>E.Coli</I> is
"....acctgcggttggatcacctcctta". Shine-Dalgarno sequence should be
complement to this sequence, i.e., "taaggaggtgatccaaccgcaggt...." .
However, this sequence is not usually conserved, and only 3 to 9
nucleotides will make pairs with the 16S rRNA 3'terminal sequence.
If the length of complementarity is too long, ribosome will bind
to mRNA too tightly, disturbing the migration of the ribosome.
There are homology between <I>E.Coli</I> 16S rRNA and that of other bacteria.<p> 

Schneider et al. has analyzed translation initiation sites
in terms of information
theory. And Barrick et al. has quantitatively analyzed 
Shine-Dalgarno sequence by the experiments.
There is a possibility that 16S rRNA binds to
multiple regions of mRNA. This may be upstream of AUG, the spacer region 
between Shine-Dalgarno sequence and AUG, or downstream of AUG.
But for downstream of AUG, the position +16 has been determined by experiments
as being the limit of the downstream region in the mRNA which interacts 
strongly with the ribosome.
I.G.Ivanov et al. has found a second putative
mRNA binding site on <I>E.Coli</I> 16S rRNA.<p>


 Distance between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and
the start codon is known to affect efficiency of translation
significantly. 
Optimal distance between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the start codon was
estimated to be 4 to 9 base pairs.<p>


Start codon is AUG in most of the time, but sometimes GUG(8%) and UUG(1%)
work as start codon. In most cases, changing the rare initiation triplet
into the more common AUG will cause the increase of expression and this
may disturb the normal mechanism of gene expression. Thus one of the reasons
that the bacteria use start codon like GUG or UUG is that they may be
appropriate for the expression control of some specific genes. Notice that
when GUG is read as a start codon, it is translated to formyl-methionine.
If we change normal AUG to GUG, translation may not occur.<p>


AUG triplets preceded by appropriately
spaced Shine-Dalgarno-like sequences appear randomly throughout the
<I>E.Coli</I> genome, which does not function as translation initiation site.
Thus, besides Shine-Dalgarno sequence and start codon and their distance,
there are some factors that affect translations. The important one is 
a secondary structure. It may separate or hide Shine-Dalgarno sequence
and/or AUG triplet.
Thus, an access of ribosome to non-initiation site of mRNA is restricted by the
secondary structure of mRNA. But a good Shine-Dalgarno complementarity
provides the ribosome with an increased affinity for its binding site,
and thereby enhances its ability to compete against the secondary 
structure.<p>

Another factors may be some consensus sequences. That are sequences 
preceding Shine-Dalgarno sequence,
sequences between Shine-Dalgarno sequence and start codon, and sequence
following the start codon.

<LI>Except for ribosome binding sites, there are not many  G's and there are
many A's and U's.
<LI>position -3 is likely to be A and position +4 through +7 is
likely to be GCUA or AAAA. In one experiment, which changed AAA to AAG,
the translational efficiency reduced by 70%.
<LI>When the sequences preceding Shine-Dalgarno sequence is eliminated,
sometimes translation does not occur.
