Dear Dr Kohno,

Peer review of your manuscript (above) is now complete, and we are
delighted, in principle, to accept the manuscript for publication in BMC
Medical Genomics. The reviews are accessible in PDF format via the web
links provided below. Do let us know if you have any problems opening
the files.

Referee 1:
http://www.biomedcentral.com/imedia/9962158764897105_comment.pdf
Referee 2:
http://www.biomedcentral.com/imedia/1625992861507470_comment.pdf
Referee 3:
http://www.biomedcentral.com/imedia/1191400931486875_comment.pdf

However, before acceptance, we would urge you to further improve the
manuscript in response to the comments made by the reviewers.
Specifically, the minor point highlighted by Referee 1.

In addition to this, we also have a request for some editorial changes
that you will need to make in your revised submission:

- Please formet the manuscripts abstarct to include separate Background,
Methods, Results and Conclusions sections, as outlined in our
instructions for authors
(http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcmedgenomics/ifora/#abstract). In
addition to this, we would also request that you go through the
manuscript formatting checklist one more time and ensure that your
revised manuscript conforms to all of the points. The link to the
formatting checklist is provided at
http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/ifora/medicine_journals

- Please deposit your microarray data in a publicly accessible database.
Please note our editorial policy on this matter:
Nucleic acid sequences, protein sequences, and atomic coordinates should
be deposited in an appropriate database in time for the accession number
to be included in the published article. In computational studies where
the sequence information is unacceptable for inclusion in databases
because of lack of experimental validation, the sequences must be
published as an additional file with the article. Where appropriate,
authors should adhere to the standards proposed by the Microarray Gene
Expression Data Society (http://www.mged.org) and must deposit
microarray data in MIAME-compliant format in one of the public
repositories, such as ArrayExpress (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress),
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/)
or the Center for Information Biology Gene Expression Database (CIBEX;
http://cibex.nig.ac.jp).


We would be grateful if you could address the comments in a revised
manuscript and provide a cover letter giving a point-by-point response
to the concerns.

Please also highlight (with 'tracked
changes'/coloured/underlines/highlighted text) all changes made when
revising the manuscript to make it easier for the Editors to give you a
prompt decision on your manuscript.

Please also ensure that your revised manuscript conforms to the journal
style (http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/ifora/medicine_journals ). It
is important that your files are correctly formatted.

We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript by 7 February 2011.
If you imagine that it will take longer to prepare please give us some
estimate of when we can expect it.

You should upload your cover letter and revised manuscript through
http://www.biomedcentral.com/manuscript/login/man.asp?txt_nav=man&txt_ma
n_id=1682302810376730. You will find more detailed instructions at the
base of this email.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any problems or
questions regarding your manuscript.

With best wishes,

Simon
