The frequencies of AUG trinucleotides around start codons
are low from our results. Thus, existing AUGs around start codons 
may have some special features to prevent or promote leaky scanning in 
order to initiate translations from the appropriate AUG. So the
following hypothesis was made.

Hypothesis:\\

\end{tabular}

 In case where two AUGs are close to each other, strong
consensus sequence exists to prevent or to promote leaky scanning.

Data analysis:\\

\end{tabular}

Calculation of the entropy of positions which is 3 bases upstream from 
AUG trinucleotides were done for the cases where
two AUGs are separated by specific number of bases.
Note that position -3 is thought to be the important position for the
translation initiation.
This calculation was done for the following 4 kinds of positions.\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Position A: Position  -3 in normal scanning.
\item Position B: Position which is 3 bases upstream from AUG trinucleotide
located downstream of start codon.
\item Position C: Position which is 3 bases upstream from AUG
trinucleotide
located upstream of start codon.
\item Position D: Position -3 in leaky scanning.
\end{enumerate}

Note that if strong consensus is observed in position A or D, that may be
the strong signal to initiate translation from that position.
If strong consensus is observed in postion B or C, that may be the
strong signal to prevent initiation from that position.

Because data for
invertebrate are less, we analyzed only vertebrates.

Figure \ref{m3ent} shows entropy of 4 kinds of positions in vertebrates.
The entropy of position -3 in general is 1.47 and
the entropy of the position which is 3 bases upstream
from the skipped AUGs in general is 2.0(not normalized according to GC
content).  
As there were not much data, entropy value tend to be low. But
entropies of position B and position C tend to be high comparing with
position A and position D.
And from this figure, we can observe that when two AUGs are separated
 by two bases, entropy of position -3 is very low(See position A in
figure \ref{m3ent}).

\label{atg_2_atg}
\end{table}

Table \ref{atg_2_atg} shows nucleotide distribution around two AUG's that are
two bases apart in vertebrates.  
The first table is for the cases where the
first AUG is selected, and the second table is
for the cases where the second AUG is selected, skipping the first.
In case where starting AUG is followed by second AUG with 2 bases in between, 
ACC[AUG]G is observed as 
a very "strong" consensus sequence around the starting AUG. Furthermore,
there are no thymine or cytosine in position -3. If the tendency of this
position is same as that of the vertebrate mRNAs in general, 
the possibility that this
occurs is less than 1\%.

Discussion:\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

As the entropies of position B and C is generally high, we suggest
that there is no strong consensus sequence at these positions to
prevent translation from non-starting AUG even when two AUGs are close 
to each other. But according to entropy of position A and position D,
there is consensus sequence at these positions to promote translation
from start codons. And we suggest that position -3 is important to
avoid leaky scanning, especially when two AUGs are separated by two bases.
