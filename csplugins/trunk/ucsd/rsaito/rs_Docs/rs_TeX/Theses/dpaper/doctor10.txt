Results are shown below. In each section, 3' terminal sequence of 16S rRNA of each species as well as its complement sequences, which shows the expected Shine-Dalgarno sequence for that specie, Because predicted 3' terminal is not always true, several bases downstream of predicted terminal are shown. And left hand side of the table shows remarkable patterns that appear upstream of start codon with its Z-score and position. Right hand side shows remarkable patterns that appear downstream. 

In most species, remarkable patterns upstream are very similar to each predicted Shine-Dalgarno sequences, which indicates that translation initiations in most bacteria are consistend with Shine-Dalgarno hypothesis. However, there are some bacteria whose remarkable patterns are not similar to its predicted Shine-Dalgarno sequence, i.e., M.genitalium, M.pneumoniae, Synechosystis, and B.burgdorferi. Highly expressed Synechosystis genes are known to have both Shine-Dalgarno sequence and special consensus, i.e. "acc" before start codons, and observation of "cc" as remarkable patterns in Synechosystis is partly consistent with this previous work by Sazuka et al. For M.pneumoniae, it is already known that many genes of this species do not have Shine-Dalgarno like sequences, since whole genome of this specie is sequenced. Also, as some previous research has pointed out(giw, ISMB), M.genitalium does not seem to have Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and it will be investigated further more.
