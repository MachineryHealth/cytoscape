Translation initiation is a process to begin a synthesis of the
protein.  It is very important biological phenomenon, because this
process is required to produce any kind of protein. There are many
previous works on translation initiation. However, many questions
about this process is still unanswered. In this paper, computer
analyses of translation initiation sites of various genes were
conducted from various points of view. And tendencies hidden in
sequences surrounding translation initiation sites were discovered,
some of which may be biologically important that it may explain
biological processes.

In this chapter, foundation of translation initiation is
explained as well as some basics of molecular biology that are necessary
to understand this paper.


\section{What are genes?}

Why is a child similar to his or her parents? This is because the child
receives the genes from his/her parents.

Genes are the factors that determine the hereditary characteristics of
organisms. A lot of information on what the organisms would be like
is written on genes. The organisms are formed according to those genes.
More precisely, proteins, which are the main factors that characterizes
organisms, are synthesized according to the information in the genes.
The gene is, in precise, a region of the molecule called DNA. 
DNA exists in the cell and forms a chromosome.
In eucaryotes(explained in \ref{cell}.),
chromosomes exist in the nucleus of the cell.

\section{Cells}
\label{cell}

All the organisms are made of a cell or cells. According to the type
of the cell, some organisms are classified into procaryotes, and some
are classified into eucaryotes.
The composition of a cell is different. Generally, procaryotes have
simpler cell compositions than that of eucaryotes.

\end{figure}

A cell consists of four kinds of molecules, i.e., sugar, fatty acid, 
amino acid and nucleotide. 
Sugar molecules form polysaccharide and fatty acid molecules
form lipid. And the chain of nucleotides form nucleic acid.
And amino acids linked by peptide bonds form protein.
Nucleic acid and protein are very large molecule and they
play important roles for organisms in maintaining life and species.

\end{table}

\section{Amino acids and proteins}

Most characteristic of organisms are determined 
by proteins. It forms tissue, catalyzes chemical activities in 
organisms, etc.. The function of a protein is determined by the kinds
of amino acids which the protein consists of. There are 20 kinds of 
amino acid. Each amino acid has its characteristics such as
hydrophilic/hydrophobic, acidic/basic, etc.. According to kinds of
amino acids and their characteristics, they form three dimensional
structures and each functions differently.
They may interact with other proteins.


\section{Nucleotides and nucleic acids}

Nucleotide consists of base, sugar, and phosphate. And there are 4
kinds of bases. Those are adenine, thymine/uracil, cytosine, and
guanine, which are abbreviated as A, T/U, C, G. When they are linked,
they form nucleic acid. Nucleic acid has direction:One end is
called 5' terminal and the other is called 3' terminal.
Nucleic acid can be expressed by its sequence of nucleotides such
as ``atcgatgcctga....'' by writing each nucleotides included in nucleic
acid from 5' terminal to 3' terminal.

There are two kinds of nucleic acid. Those are DNA(deoxyribonucleic
acid) and RNA(ribonucleic acid).  Information about what kind of
proteins will be made is stored in DNA, which includes gene region, and
it is passed to descendants.  DNA chains are double stranded, and A
pairs with T, and C pairs with G. On the other hand, RNA is usually
single stranded.  Nucleotide included in RNA can easily make pairs with
other nucleotide included in RNA itself. The structure that an RNA chain
forms by self pairings is called a secondary structure.  As RNA can form
higher order structure, it can mediate some activities in the cell,
whereas DNA usually works only as a template.  There are 3 kinds of RNA
and each has different functions.  Base T is used in DNA and base U is
used instead in RNA.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
name of nucleic acid & main function\\

\hline
DNA & carries information of genes\\
\hline
mRNA & copies of DNA and work as template in synthesis of protein\\
\hline
tRNA & links a group of three nucleotides(codon) with 
amino acids \\
\hline
rRNA & helps to synthesize proteins in ribosomes\\
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\end{table}

\section{Transcription}


How the protein is made according to the information written on DNA is
described in this section and \ref{intr_trans}.  DNA is not directly
converted to protein.  First, an enzyme called polymerase reads
nucleotides on DNA chain and synthesizes a molecule called mRNA. This
process is called transcription.


In the process of transcription, the nucleotide sequence written on DNA
is copied to mRNA. But A is transcribed into U, T is transcribed into A,
C is transcribed into G, and G is transcribed into C.

Expression of genes are mostly modulated in the transcription level.
Thus, the process of the transcription is investigated by many
researchers. However, there are still many things that is not
understood in transcription, especially for eucaryotes.


\section{Translation}
\label{intr_trans}

Translation is a process that the molecule called ribosome reads
nucleotides on transcribed mRNA and synthesizes a protein according to
nucleotides on mRNA.

In the process of translation, protein is synthesized according to the
information written on mRNA. It is described in figure \ref{trans1}.
A group of three nucleotides(called a codon
and there are \(4^{3}=64\) of them) corresponds to one of 20 kinds of
amino acids. This correspondence is mainly determined by the RNA
molecule called tRNA. This correspondance is almost the same for all
organisms.

Nucleotide pattern on
translation initiation site is usually ``AUG''.

\section{Translation initiation}

Now, we can discuss about translation initiation in detail. Usually
transcribed mRNA will be translated into protein. However, only part
of mRNA is translated. There is a point to initiate translation. That
point is called start codon. And the process that ribosomes initiate
translation at a start codon is called translation initiation. And
regions associated with translation initiation, including start codon
is called translation initiation site. Translation initiation is very
complex process and involves many molecules. The greatest question is:
how can ribosome recognize start codon very accurately? The ultimate
goal of this research is to give complete answer to this question. The
key is to extract tendencies hidden in sequences in translation
initiation sites.

\section{Coding region and non coding region}

As we have discussed, information coded in DNA will be transcribed and
translated into protein. However, all part of DNA is not transcribed.
The region that will be trascribed and translated is called coding
region. And the region that will not be transcribed and translated is
called non coding region. Non coding regions do not code
proteins. Often they are just junk. However, sometimes they have
regulatory information. For example, sequence patterns TATAAT are
often found upstream of transcription initiation sites(in non coding
region, of course). They direct polymerase to initiate transcription
from about 17 bases downstream. Some regulatory information about
translation initiation is also coded in non coding regions.

\section{Method: Sequence analysis}

Many biological information are coded in both coding regions and non
coding regions of DNA/RNA. It codes not only what kinds of proteins
will be synthesized but also what kind of regulation will
occur. Information about translation initiation is no exception.  In
this paper, analyses of sequence patterns surrounding translation
initiation sites were conducted to obtain more knowledge about
translation initiation. To discover hidden tendencies in DNA/RNA,
large amount of sequences are required. In this paper, sequences in
GenBank\cite{label1700} database were used. GenBank\footnote{Genetic
Sequence DataBank}, maintained by NIH\footnote{National Institute of
Health}, incorporates DNA/RNA sequences from all available public
sources, primarily through the direct submission of sequence data from
individual laboratories and from large-scale sequencing projects. It
contains more than 1,000,000 different sequences and increasing very
rapidly, which is appropriate for the purpose of this work. Original
programs were written to extract sequences from GenBank, and
statistical analyses of these sequences were conducted.


\section{Composition of this paper}

This paper describes discovered tendencies hidden in translation
initiation sites as well as discription of biological interpretation
and significance of these discoveries. Chapter \ref{survey} describes
known translation initiation mechanisms with survey on the research of
this field. From chapter \ref{consensus} to \ref{neg_atg} is result of
the research. In chapter \ref{consensus}, comprehensive analyses of
consensus patterns surrounding start codons are conducted to determine
translation initiation signals. In chapter \ref{chiyo}, correlations
of start codons and signal strength of Shine-Dalgarno sequence are
investigated to find out characteristics of alternative start
codons(GUG and UUG) in procaryotes. In chapter \ref{correlation},
characteristics of base correlations surrounding start codons are
described.  In chapter \ref{neg_atg}, scanning mechanisms as well as
characteristic patterns of frequencies of ATG triplets are discussed.
Conclusion for this research is given in chapter \ref{conclusion}.
