GSFS is a mountable GenomeSpace file system based on FUSE (File system in USEr space).
The Mac OS implementation will run as a module under OSXFUSE, the successor to MacFUSE.
You can download OSXFUSE here: https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/downloads
Ports that I installed included "file", "zlib" and "pcre".
