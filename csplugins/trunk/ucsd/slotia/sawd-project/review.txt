THE SAWD PROJECT REVIEW

0. NOTICE. Because the project is divided across several programs,
   it is recommended to read the section "A Quick Runthrough" in the readme
   file first. This gives an overview of the various programs in this project.

1. OVERALL DESIGN. In the "Introduction" section of the readme, the goals and
   motivations of the project are specified. What is your opinion of the
   client-server paradigm that serves as a basis of this project? Do you feel
   it correctly addresses the limitations of other projects? What problems
   you forsee a client-server paradigm introduces not addressed in the readme?
   (For example, potential problems include performance penalties and security
   issues.)

2. PROTOCOL DESIGN. Do you feel the protocol is sufficient for a wide range
   of cases? Do you believe the protocol is simple enough to quickly write
   clients of the protocol? (This question is about the protocol itself:
   complaints about things like the way commands were named should be listed
   here.)

3. USABILITY. What usability issues came up when using SawdServer,
   SawdVisualizer, load_graph.py, and force_layout.py? What was confusing
   using the programs?

4. DOCUMENTATION. Any concerns regarding the readme file provided? Was it
   useful in describing how to use the programs effectively? Was it confusing?

5. BUGS. Did you find any bugs in any of the programs?

6. EXTRA COMMENTS. Add any comments in this section that do not apply to any
   other.
