This project exists to run basic performance tests on Cytoscape's
implementations of the core model API.  There are two parts to
this.  

First are the unit tests which are intended to run in an continuous 
build system (i.e. cruisecontrol) such that they are triggered 
after any changes to the model project.  The hope is to catch 
performance problems relatively early.

Second is a simple Main class that loads a bunch of nodes and edges
for a CyNetwork and exits.  The intent for this class is to be used 
with JProfiler so that the CyNetwork implementation can be more
closely analyzed.  

To run in JProfiler, simply configure JProfiler to execute the following:

  java -jar target/model-performance-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

No class path is necessary since all of the dependencies for the bundle
are included in the jar.
