Defines the interfaces and utility classes that can be used to define tunable values in 
Cytoscape objects.  Tunables are a mechanism for exposing fields in a class that can
be changed by a TunableInterceptor.  A TunableInterceptor is a class that extracts all
annotated fields and based on the type of the field presents a user interface to the
user which can be used to set the values of the fields.  This is intended as a mechanism
to generate a simple user interface for arbitrary Commands that allow the fields necessary
for the Command to run to be set.  The goal is to free the Command writer from worrying 
about writing a user interface and to therefore allow the Command to operate in alternative
user interfaces (e.g. Swing GUI and command line).
