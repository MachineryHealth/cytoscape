There are two checkstyle configurations included in this package. 
The first (checkstyle-build) is run at build time and validates basic 
formatting only.  The second (checkstyle-site) is run in the site phase 
and does more complete checking.  The goal is to strike a balance 
between maintaining basic formatting guidelines without being overly
strick, while at the same time providing feedback on design issues 
to be fixed prior to release.
