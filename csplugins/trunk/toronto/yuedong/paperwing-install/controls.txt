Camera movement
===============

Movement
--------

W: Move camera up
A: Move camera left
S: Move camera down
D: Move camera right
E: Move camera forward
Q: Move camera backwards

Rotation
--------

Z: Roll camera clockwise
X: Roll camera counter-clockwise

Shift + Left/Right: Rotation about Y-axis
Shift + Up/Down: Rotation about X-axis

Note that currently, both these rotations rotate around axes that intersect a "target point". This point, located in front of the camera, is used as the centre of rotation. The mouse wheel can adjust the distance between the camera and the target point. Moving the target point close to the network centre will cause rotations to rotate the network about its centre. The target point moves with the camera.

Arrow Keys: Turn camera
