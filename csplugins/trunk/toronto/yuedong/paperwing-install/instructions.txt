Description
===========

This installer will check out the latest build of Cytoscape, the latest build of the 3D renderer plugin (no official name yet, but it is currently dubbed "Wind"), and patch the Cytoscape build to accommodate the renderer plugin.

Requirements
============

Maven 3 or later
Bash

Running Cytoscape with the renderer
===================================

1. Run download-and-install.sh to download and install the renderer.
2. Run start.sh to start Cytoscape with the renderer.

Note that the download and installation portion will take longer if you don't already have a copy of the Cytoscape core bundles in your Maven repository directory.

3. To undo the patches for running regular Cytoscape, run remove_patches.sh
