Description
===========

This installer will check out the latest build of Cytoscape, the latest build of the 3D renderer plugin (no official name yet, but it is currently dubbed "Wind"), and patch the Cytoscape build to accommodate the renderer plugin.

Requirements
============

Maven 3 or later
Bash

Running Cytoscape with the renderer
===================================

1. Run download-and-install.sh to download and install the renderer.
2. Run start.sh to start Cytoscape with the renderer.

NOTE: If you want to be able to run regular Cytoscape afterwards, you will need to do a mvn install on the unpatched versions of the following Cytoscape bundles:

presentation-impl
swing-application-impl
vizmap-gui-impl

However, it seems that waiting until midnight will also remove the patched versions. But, a later version of the installer would hopefully remove the need to re-perform installing of the unlatched bundles.

Camera controls, selection, node dragging
=========================================

Please see controls.txt
