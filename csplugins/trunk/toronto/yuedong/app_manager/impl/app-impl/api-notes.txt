Get App Status
==============

URL
---

GET  http://127.0.0.1:2608/status?appname=<app_name>

Notes: App_name is the app store unique app name. For web-downloaded apps, it will be the same 
as the Cytoscape-App-Name entry in the manifest. If no matches were found in web apps, we 
will look for matches using only the Cytoscape-App-Name entry.

Response
--------

{
 "request_name": The app name requested by the app store
 "status": installed, uninstall-on-restart, uninstalled, or not-found. Not found would 
mean the app isn't found on the user's computer.
 "version": The version of the app, as found in the Cytoscape-App-Version manifest entry,
or "not-found" if not available.
}

Install an App
==============

URL
---

GET  http://127.0.0.1:2608/install?appname=<app_name>&version=<version>

Response
--------

The server attempts to query the app from the app store. If no matches were found 
for the version, or if the version information was absent, we will try to get the latest 
version.

Upon completion, the server sends the following:

{
 "app_name": The name of the install app
 "install_status": The result of the installation. Values could be: success, 
app-not-found, version-not-found.
}
