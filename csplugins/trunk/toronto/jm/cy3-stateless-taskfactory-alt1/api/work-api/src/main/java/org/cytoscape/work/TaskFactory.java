/**
 *  Returns an instance of a {@link TaskIterator}.  Intended to be 
 *  used as an OSGi service, singleton, every type of <code>Task</code> has one.
 *  <br />
 *  Let's say you'd like to do some kind of processing, let's call it "X".  Then you would create a
 *  class called XTask, where the processing would be taking place in XTask's run() method.  Assuming
 *  X needs to have two types of data, let's call them Y and Z, in order to control its behavior.
 *  This would imply that XTask's constructor should take an X and a Y as parameters.  And XTaskFactory
 *  should have setY() and setZ() methods.  XTaskFactory's createTaskIterator() method would then construct
 *  an XTask with the Y and Z that it has available and create a {@link TaskIterator} with this single Task to
 *  iterate over.
