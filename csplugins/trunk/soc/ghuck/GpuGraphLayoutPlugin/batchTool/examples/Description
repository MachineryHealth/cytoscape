Here are the commands that are currently supported that can be included in the script file:

    * open sessionfile
          o Open a session file
    * import [network|node attributes|edge attribute] filename
          o Import a network or attribute data
    * layout layout-algorithm tunable1=value1 tunable2=value2 etc.
          o Layout the network using the layout layout-algorithm with the tunables set to the appropriate values
    * export [vizmap|node attributes|edge attributes] to filename
          o Export the vizmap and node or edge attributes to a file
    * export network as [XGMML, PSI-MI, GML, SIF, PDF, SVG, PNG, GIF, JPG] to filename
          o Export a network as either a network data file or a graphics file
    * save as filename
          o Save a Cytoscape session file
    * apply vizmap
          o Apply vizmap map vizmap to the current network
    * exit
          o Exit Cytoscape

Example (test.com):

    import network pte.xgmml
    import node attributes subgroup.noa
    layout force-directed
    export network as pdf to test.pdf zoom=10
    exit

You can execute this file by executing Cytoscape with the "-S" flag:

    cytoscape.sh -S test.com


Here are the tunables for some of the cytoscape layouts:
