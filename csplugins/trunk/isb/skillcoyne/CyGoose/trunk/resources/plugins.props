pluginDescription=The CyGoose Cytoscape Plugin gives any network in Cytoscape full access to the Gaggle. 
The Gaggle is a tool to create a data exploration and analysis environment. 
Other geese (independent threads/tools which Cytoscape can now interact with through the Gaggle Boss) 
can be found at http://gaggle.systemsbiology.org/docs/geese/. 
ISSUE: This goose does not work with a local install of Cytoscape on a Windows machine. It will work with Mac or Linux and 
as a webstart on Mac/Linux/Windows. We are working on this and will release a fix as soon as we can.
