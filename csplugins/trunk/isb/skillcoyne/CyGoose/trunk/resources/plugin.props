pluginDescription=The CyGoose Cytoscape Plugin gives any network in Cytoscape full access to the Gaggle.<br>As of version 2.6 of the plugin, it works with the current (2007-04) revision of the Gaggle API.<br>
The Gaggle is a tool to create a data exploration and analysis environment. Other geese (independent threads/tools which Cytoscape can now interact with through the Gaggle Boss) 
can be found at <a href="http://gaggle.systemsbiology.org/docs/geese/">http://gaggle.systemsbiology.org/docs/geese/</a>.<p>
<p><b>Known bug:</b> This goose does not work with a local install of Cytoscape on a Windows machine. It will work with Mac or Linux and as a webstart on Mac/Linux/Windows.
<br>We are working on this and will release a fix as soon as we can.
