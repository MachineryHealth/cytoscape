How to use the plugin:
(For best results, run the layout after smoothing the
graph using an algorithm such as the Spring Embedded
Layout.)
To initialize the layout, just run HypFocus from the
Layout menu, making sure that no nodes are selected.
This will allow the plugin to know that you intend to
initialize.
To refocus the layout, run HypFocus after selecting
the node you would like to refocus, too. Then when
JOptionPane pops up, enter the index of the selected
node.
