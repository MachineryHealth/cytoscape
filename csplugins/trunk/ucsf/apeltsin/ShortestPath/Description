ShortestPath Plugin
Version: 1.0
Release Date: January 25, 2007
Verified to work in 2.4

ShortestPath is a plugin for Cytoscape to show the shortest weighted path
between 2 selected nodes in the current network. It is based on the
<a href="http://csresources.sourceforge.net/ShortestPath/">ShortestPath</a>
plugin developed by Marcio Rosa da Silva.  This updated version 
supports the use of edge attributes to calculate the path lengths.
It supports both directed and undirected networks and it gives the user
the possibility to choose which node (of the selected ones) should be
used as source and target (useful for directed networks). The plugin
API makes possible to use its functionality from another plugin.
