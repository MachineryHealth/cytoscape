Now
- testing and bug fixing
- make list of parameters which will appear in parameter dialog box, design user
	interaction (when will dialog box appear?)

Later
- memory use during transitive reduction can be excessive.
	This happens when the longest path is very long (>2000).
	If this is a problem, the list of descendants approach can be scrapped.
- edge crossing reduction needs to be examined.
	The current approach is ad hoc. Some rigorous approach should
	be implemented from Sugiyama chapter.
- horizontal positioning needs to be implemented
	The current approach is ad hoc. Some rigorous approach should
	be implemented from Sugiyama chapter.
- selection -> layout in place v. layout and make room
	Currently, any unselected nodes are moved out of the way
	to make room. Some approach to layout selected nodes while
	respecting the position of surrounding nodes will be wanted.
	Maybe multiple approaches to this.
- parameter dialog box
	Give the user the ability to set maximum layer width, for example.
- multi-edge depiction
	Synonymous edges currently are drawn on top of each other.
- dummy verticies and indirect routing of edges
	All edges do not have to be straight lines, perhaps. Also, the
	Sugiyama edge crossing reduction requires "proper" layers
	without edges that do not skip a layer. This needs to be handled
	somehow.
- consider moving some graph analysis functions into giny.
	Evaluate using giny graph data structure in the core hierarchical
	layout (general graph layout mechanisms can be available for
	all giny users)
