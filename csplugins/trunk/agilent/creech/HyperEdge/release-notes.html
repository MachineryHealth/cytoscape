<H1>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.62)</H1>
<OL>
<LI>Fixed bug where custom ConnectorNode labels were erased when restoring saved HyperEdges.</LI>
</OL>

<H1>Prior Notes</H1>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.61)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Massive low-level code changes to get HyperEdge to pass Checkstyle with
the checkstyle-warn.xml ruleset.</LI>
<LI>Changed to use CyLogger in HEUtils and remove use of System.out.println.</LI>
<P><LI>Updated to use LSIUtils 0.12.</LI></P>
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.60)</H2>
<OL>

<LI>Fixed Mantis bug 1837--reading a session or saved network
    was not reconstructing all information needed to correctly
    represent HyperEdges (e.g., _net_to_hes_map).
<P> This would lead to HyperEdges not being correctly removed and then
  errors (e.g., HEStructuralIntegrityException) occurring when
  reloading the same HyperEdges from a session or saved network file.
</LI>
<P><LI>Updated some test cases to better test save/restore of HyperEdges.</LI></P>
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.59)</H2>
Implementation changes only:
<OL>
<LI>Migrated ListenerList to LSIUtils com.agilent.labs.lsiutils.ListenerStore.
<P><LI>Changed code to use migrated ListenerStore.
<P><LI>Updated HyperEdgeManagerImpl to use stronger typing thru generics.
<P><LI>Updated to use new LSIUtils (v0.11).
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.58)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Changed when ConnectorNodes are really deleted from the delayed
deletion list.
<P>A change was forced by the fact that the CytoscapeEditor menu item
that was overridden by the HyperEdgeEditor was removed (the
functionality was moved into the Cytoscape core). Now, the
ConnectorNodes are removed whenever a NETWORK_MODIFIED event is fired.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.57)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Updated build script.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.56)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Updated to include new LSIUtils (v0.09).
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.55)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Changed unittests to set load and save location to use the
Cytoscape PluginManager directory structure for placing files.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.54)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Updated to include jarlib/lsiutils.jar (v0.08).
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.53)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Updated for use with new Cytoscape PluginManager that now uses a
plugin.props file and removed no longer used
HyperEdgePlugin.getPluginInfoObject().
<P><LI>Stopped this plugin from being an independent plugin.
<P>This is because this plugin is
supplied by the HyperEdgeEditor and there are too many issues with dependent
plugins at this time--especially when multiple versions are available. 
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.52)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Changed package structure from
com.agilent.labs.hyperedge-->cytoscape.hyperedge.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.51)</H2>
<OL>

<LI>Updated LitSearchPlugin.getPluginInfoObject() for changes to the
PluginManager.
<P><LI>Changed use of
CyAttributes.deleteAttribute()->HEUtils.deleteAttribute() due to
Cytoscape bug.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.50)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Made HyperEdge be a good citizen for the Cytoscape PluginManager.
<P> Added HyperEdgePlugin.getPluginInfoObject().
<P><LI>Added no arg version of
HyperEdgeManagerImpl.hideConnectorNodes() that removes nodes from all
Networks.

</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.4 alfa 6)</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Commented out various debugging statements.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.4 alfa 5)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Added the delayed node deletion solution to the recursive
hiding problem (see HyperEdge documents, deletion-issues.txt).

<P>This involved removing use of HyperEdgeManager.DeletedCatcher and
adding HyperEdgeManager.hideConnectorNodes() and
HyperEdgeManager.addToDelayedHidingMap().

</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.4 alfa 4)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Added removeEdgeBookkeeping() and removeFromNetworkBookkeeping(),
 and use of BookkeepingItem in attempted fix problem with rehiding
 GraphObjects in GraphPerspectiveChanged() event callback.
 Will be modified/removed in future.
<P><LI>Fixed bug in removeNodeInfoWhenNeeded() where nodes that are
  both regular nodes and ConnectorNodes (via a shared edge) were
  having their attributes removed when a shared edge connecting them
  was removed.
<P><LI>Added HEUtils.getEdgeInteractionType() and updated
HEUtils.toString() method to handle HyperEdges.
<P><LI>Fixed bug where ConnectorNodes read in needed to have their
CANONICAL_NAME attribute removed (so their names don't show up in the
BioChemicalReaction visual style).
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.4 alfa 3)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Changed HyperEdge methods: addToCyNetwork()-->addToNetwork(),
 getCyNetwork()-->getNetwork(), inCyNetwork()-->inNetwork(), and
 removeFromCyNetwork()-->removeFromNetwork().
<P><LI>Changed HyperEdgeManager methods:
getEdgesByCyNetwork-->getEdgesByNetwork(),
getHyperEdgesByCyNetwork()-->getHyperEdgesByNetwork().

<P><LI>Added creation and removal of ENTITY_TYPE_ATTRIBUTE_NAME attribute to
ConnectorNodes and regular nodes for use by HyperEdgeEditor.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.4 alfa 2)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Implemented HyperEdge.connectHyperEdges().

<P><LI>Implemented HyperEdge.copy()

<P>All attributes of the ConnectorNode and CyEdges are also copied.

<P><LI>Changed HyperEdge.addEdge() to not allow two edges with the same
    characteristics (throws an exception
    if an edge already exists to the given node and with the same edgeIType).

<P><LI>Changed HyperEdge.destroy() to remove the HyperEdge's
ConnectorNode from each CyNetwork to which it belongs when no
"regular" edges connect to it in each CyNetwork.

<P><LI>Added a Glycolysis reaction sample network demonstrating
HyperEdges with shared CyEdges.


<P><LI>Changed created Edges to use standard Cytoscape getCyEdge and create
standard Cytoscape edge identifier.

<P><LI>Changed so deletion of Nodes, Edges, and Networks update
HyperEdge structures.

<P><LI>Fixed reloading of HyperEdges containing shared edges.

<P>The issue here is that HyperEdges with shared edges can only exist
in one CyNetwork. Reloading a file with such HyperEdges attempts to
place these HyperEdges in multiple CyNetworks. The current approach
this problem is to copy the HyperEdges in the newly loaded CyNetwork
so that they are separate HyperEdges that, once again, only exist in
one CyNetwork.

<P><LI>Changed shared edges to no longer have two interaction types
and went back to having interaction types defined by
Semantics.INTERACTION attribute versus generated attribute based on
ConnectorNode uuid.

<P><LI>Added HyperEdge.hasSharedEdges(), HyperEdge.getSharedEdges(),
HyperEdge.isSharedEdge(), HyperEdge.getNode().

<P><LI> Added HyperEdgeManager.isHyperEdgeEdge ().

<P><LI>Migrated sample networks to HyperEdgeEditor.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.4 alfa 1)</H2>

Major API and implementation change from GINY GraphPerpsectives,
Nodes, and Edges to Cytoscape CyNetworks, CyNodes, and CyEdges.

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.1.1)</H2>
<OL>

<LI>Changed HyperEdgeManager.getNodesByEdgeTypes() to be ORing of edge
interaction types versus ANDing.
<P><LI>Removed complicated internal datastructure--_gp_to_nodes_map and
RefCountMultiValue class.
<P><LI>Changed storing of Edge interaction types in preparation for allowing
shared edges.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.1)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Changed overall API and implementation so that HyperEdges are shared
across GraphPerspectives (based on decisions made at the Cytoscape 2006
Retreat).
<P>Any change to a HyperEdge existing in more than one
GraphPerspective is reflected in all GraphPerspectives to which the
HyperEdge belongs. This is similar behavior to HyperEdge 1.0 alfa 8.
<P><LI>Added more strong typing of generic collections used throughout
HyperEdge.
<P><LI>Updated build.properties for Cytoscape 2.4 changes.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.0 alfa 5)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Many HyperEdge methods changed to remove use of GraphPerspective (e.g. getEdges()).
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.0 alfa 4)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Changed name of Persistent interface to Identifiable interface.

<P>Since this interface now only contains one method getIdentifier(),
the name no longer seemed appropriate.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.0 alfa 3)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Various Java 1.5 changes including:
<P><OL type=a>
<LI>Changing LifeState to a Java 1.5 enum.
<LI>Strongly typing all code so no Java 1.5 warnings are issued.
<LI>Creating various generic classes (e.g., MapUtils) and methods.
</OL>

<P><LI>Changing to use new LSIUtils versus quattrolite.
<P>HyperEdge is now completely free from ALFA and BlueOakSoftware code.

<P><LI>Fixing bug in HyperEdge.getNodesByEdgeTypes() where an empty
iterator would be returned when the GrapPerspective and edgeITypes is
non-null.

<P><LI>Changing API for createHyperEdge(Collection...)-->
createHyperEdge(List...) because the elements must be ordered.

<P><LI>Adding HyperEdge.connectHyperEdges() to API, but not yet
implemented.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.0 alfa 2)</H2>

Changed API so the underlying "rootgraph" of a HyperEdge,
independent of any GraphPerspective, is not accessable. This includes:
<OL>
<LI>Changing all HyperEdge contructors to require an initial
GraphPerspective to place the newly constructed HyperEdge.

<LI>Changing HyperEdge.addToGraphPerspective() to take a source and target
GraphPerpsective.

<LI>Changing HyperEdge.removeFromGraphPerspective() to perform
HyperEdge.destroy() if GraphPerspective is null.

<LI>Changing HyperEdge.addEdge() to require the HyperEdge to belong to
the given GraphPerspective before an edge can be added.

<LI>Changing HyperEdge.inGraphPerspective() to require gp to be non-null.

<LI>Adding HyperEdge.getMinimumNumberEdges ().

<LI>Changing deletion of HyperEdges to hide edges and leave the
ConnectorNode alone (similar to removing an Edge in Cytoscape).

<LI>Various semantic changes to HyperEdge.removeEdge() and
HyperEdge.removeNode().

</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 2.0 alfa 1)</H2>

This is an intermediate state major iteration of the HyperEdge
API not ment for public release. Changes include:

<OL>
<LI>Major API changes to support HyperEdges with different numbers of
nodes and edges within each GraphPerspective. Most HyperEdge
operations and constructors have been changed by adding a
GraphPerspective parameter.

<LI>Refactoring HyperEdge event handling moving all event handling
operations to the HyperEdgeManager and adding GraphPerspective
information to various events notifications.

<LI>Moving to Java 5 based library with strongly typed collections and
MapUtils and RefCountMultiValue becoming generic classes of
operations.

<LI>Migrating all add/removeXXXListeners to HyperEdgeManager from
  HyperEdgeFactory and HyperEdge.

<LI>Adding HyperEdge.addToGraphPerspective (),
     HyperEdge.removeFromPerspective (), and HyperEdge.inGraphPerspective().

<LI>Removing EdgeTypeMap persistent related methods and adding
   EdgeTypeMap.reset().

<LI>Removing Explicit persistence classes and interfaces.

<P>All state information (e.g., directed, name) are now stored as
    attribute info on connector node.
<P>Removed all load, save, and "dirty" related operations and classes.

<LI>Removed interface Mutable.

</OL>

NOTE: Due to how Cytoscape works, multiple edges to the same node with
the same interaction type will not restore correctly.

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 1.0 alfa 8)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Added HyperEdge.getNodesByEdgeTypes(Collection)

<P>This is useful for returning all Nodes connected by edges that
belong to one or more interation types. For example, getting an
Iterator of all nodes that are Mediators--either inhibiting or
activating.

<P>Updated HyperEdgeTest to test usage of this new operation.

<P><LI>Fixed bug where HyperEdge.addEdge() was not correctly adding
the new edge and node to all graph perspectives that the HyperEdge belongs to.

<P>It also was not setting HyperEdgeManager _gp_to_edges_map correctly. Added HyperEdgeManagerTests for this bug.

<P><LI>Added EdgeTypeMap.INHIBITING_MEDIATOR and
       EdgeTypeMap.ACTIVATING_MEDIATOR.

<P>Deprecated EdgeTypeMap.MEDIATOR.

</OL>


<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 1.0 alfa 7)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Changed use of Semantics.LABEL-->AttributeConstants.MONIKER.
</OL>


<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 1.0 alfa 6)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Changed references to Semantics.CANONICAL_NAME-->Semantics.LABEL
and commented out references to Semantics.COMMON_NAME.
</OL>
<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 1.0 alfa 5)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Various changes and additions to handle new ANT build process.
<P>Changes include local 'libs' jar files removed, javadoc files
removed, added .xml and .properties files.

<P><LI>Updated to use new Cytoscape 2.3.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 1.0 alfa 4)</H2>
<OL>
<P><LI>Added new EdgeTypeMap

<P>Maps an edge_i_type to an EdgeRole for determining the placement within
an Edge of any Node added to a HyperEdge using that edge_i_type.

<P><LI>Added creation of isConnectorNode attribute for all Connector Nodes.

<P><LI>Removed HyperEdge .hpe storage from Cytoscape load and
save Network operations (piggybacked).

<P>Load and Save are removed until Cytoscape fixes its .gml and .sif
load and save to handle the identifiers associated with Edges and
Nodes. This problem causes duplicate Nodes and Edges to be incorrectly
created.

<P><LI>Beefed up JUnit tests

<P>Added EdgeTypeMapTest and added to several other test modules.

<P><LI>Changed load/save to escape common characters in fields that would
disrupt XML representation.
<P>For example, double-quote, '<', and '&'.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 1.0 alfa 3)</H2>
<OL>
<P><LI>Refactored save() and load() operations and added Format parameter to
HyperEdge.save ().

<P><LI>Changed use of edge_i_type throughout HyperEdge to determine
whether a Node will be the source or target of a created Edge.

<P>If edge_i_type is PRODUCT, the edge added will have the Node as
   the target of the edge. For SUBSTRATE, MEDIATOR, and any other
   types given, the Node will be the source of the new edge.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 1.0 alfa 2)</H2>
<OL>
<P><LI>Added user display feedback of loading and saving HyperEdge
   information.
<P><LI>Added HyperEdgeManager.getEdgesByNode().
<P><LI>Fixed HyperEdgeManager.getNodesByEdgeTypes() to work correctly.
<P><LI>Changed suffix for loading and saving hyperedge files from .xml to .hpe.
<P><LI>Changed to strictly append .hpe suffix to file name written
      versus remove old suffix and append new .hpe suffix.

<P>This is necessary because user may write a network in more than one
form, such as .sif and .gml and we want a separate .hpe file for each.

<P><LI>Added removal of automatically generated attributes on
Connector Nodes and Edges when a HyperEdge is removed.
<P><LI>Added patches for Cytoscape getNode() and getEdge() bugs.
<P><LI>Changed sample networks to have HyperEdges more appropriately named.
<P><LI>Fixed JUnit tests to write to Cytoscape user's home directory
in '.hyperedge/test-results/' directory.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdge Release Notes (version 1.0 alfa 1)</H2>

This is the first rough cut implementation of the HyperEdge API.
To use, place lib/hyperedge.jar into Cytoscape '/plugins/core' directory.

<P>Then run Cytoscape and execute 'Plugins-->HyperEdge Plugin'.  This
will load two HyperEdge CyNetworks without initial views.  The
'File-->Load-->Network...',  'File-->Save-->Network As Interactions' and
'File-->Save-->Network As GML' will seamlessly save and load
HyperEdges along with your Cytoscape structures.

<P>To compile, point at your cytoscape 2.2 libraries in your Eclipse project.
