<H2>HyperEdgeEditor Release Notes (version 0.06)</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Added intelligent setting of the drag cursor for HyperEdgeEditor-specific
palette entries so that the cursor shows you can't perform a drop operation unless you are on a ConnectorNode.
<P>Updated to use CytoscapeEditor DragSourceContextCursorSetters and
created new HyperEdgePaletteItemDragCursorSetter.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdgeEditor Release Notes (version 0.05)</H2>
<OL>

<P><LI>Added basic Node & Edge creation ability to HyperEdgeEditor.

<P>Dropping an Edge palette entry on a ConnectorNode will add an Edge
to a HyperEdge. 

<P><LI>Added ability to drop an edge palette entry on an edge in the
canvas.

<P> When an edge palette item is dragged onto a Node (source) and then the
     rubberband edge is dropped on another Edge (target), this deletes the
     first target Edge and replaces with a new HyperEdge with three other
     Edges. For example, if we have:
<PRE>
       A--->B
       C--->D
</PRE>
     If we drop an edge palette item onto C (source) and then onto the
     edge in between A & B (target), then this creates:
<PRE>
        A---.-->B
            ^
            |
            C
</PRE>
     This may lead to a HyperEdge-HyperEdge connection if the edge
     dropped onto is a HyperEdge edge. For example, if we drop an edge
     palette item onto M2 (source) and then onto the edge in between
     M1 and the ConnectorNode in:
<PRE>
        S--.-->P
           ^      M2
           |
           M1
     Then we would get:

        S--.-->P
           ^
           |
           .<----M2
           ^
           |
           M1
</PRE>

<P><LI>Added ability to drop an edge palette entry on an edge on the
canvas.

<P><LI> Added ability to delete a HyperEdge

<P> Added two popup menu items for deleting a HyperEdge
         from current network and from all networks. 

<P><LI> Added ability to select a HyperEdge

<P> Right-click on a ConnectorNode, to get popup menu item
    "HyperEdge->Select" This ignores selected nodes/edges--only works
    on the ConnectorNode that was right-clicked on. Actually selects
    the ConnectorNode and edges but not nodes that are part of the
    HyperEdge. Places HyperEdge on a "clipboard" for future use.
    Previous selections are unselected.

<P><LI>Changed to use new CytoscapeEditor palette generator for
       creating HyperEdgeEditor palette.

<P><LI> Fixed translation bug where drop location is screen coordinates
      versus canvas coordinates.

<P><LI>Added popup menu item "HyperEdge" which is a submenu with Select
      and Delete menu items. Delete is itself a submenu with "Delete
      From This Network" and "Delete From All Networks" menu items.

<P><LI> Ensure initial vismap display of networks to be correct (same as
      minimizing and then maximizing the network window, which does the
      right thing).

<P><LI> Added tooltips to nodes and edges.

<P><LI>Fixed bug in BioChemicalReactionVisualStyle with using read in visual properties.

<P><LI>Changed BioChemicalReactionVisualStyle to use new controlling
attributes: Semantics.INTERACTION for Edges and
HyperEdgeImpl.ENTITY_TYPE_ATTRIBUTE_NAME for Nodes.

<P>This uses newly generated attributes in HyperEdge 2.4.

<P><LI>Patched HyperEdgeEditor to work when loaded before CytoscapeEditor.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdgeEditor Release Notes (version 0.04)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Added sample networks (migrated from HyperEdge).

<P>These are currently available off the Cytoscape
File->Import->HyperEdge Sample Networks menu.

<P><LI>Refactored and updated BioChemicalReaction visual style to use
    undeprecated API for Cytoscape 2.4.
    
<P><LI>Updated for use with HyperEdge 2.4 alfa 2.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdgeEditor Release Notes (version 0.03)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Updated for use with HyperEdge 2.4 alfa 1.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdgeEditor Release Notes (version 0.02)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Updated for use with HyperEdge 2.1.1.
</OL>

<H2>HyperEdgeEditor Release Notes (version 0.01)</H2>

An initial version of a HyperEdge Editor. The Editor appears off the
Editor tab of CytoPanel 1 when the visual style is
BioChemicalReaction.

<P>The jar representing the HyperEdgeEditor is called HyperEdgeEditor.jar.
