<H1>Cytoscape-AG Release Notes (version 0.04)</H1>
Following is a list of the modifications (see comments with "MLC 02/02/10"):
<OL>
<LI>Changed EMBEDDED_WINDOW mode to not dispose of the CytoscapeDesktop on exit.

<P>We would like to just dispose of the desktop, but Cytoscape is not
designed to create a new Cytoscape while another is still alive.  In
other words, we can't just call 'CyMain.main (args)' and have a new
Cytoscape that we can use. Many operations, like
Cytoscape.getDesktop() just return a singleton instance that is now
bound to the old desktop. To make matters worse, all the data content
(mapping structures, nodes, networks) from previous usage is there. So
our approach is to just make the existing desktop not visible and
reset Cytoscape to a new session by calling:
<PRE>
     getDesktop().setVisible (false);
     Cytoscape.createNewSession ();
</PRE>
Changes were made in cytoscape.Cytoscape.java.

<H2>Cytoscape-AG Release Notes (version 0.03)</H2>
Following is a list of the modifications (see comments with "MLC 01/31/10"):
<OL>
<LI>Added temporary ability to remove popup context menu for "WikiPathways Web Service Client", controlled by the runstring parameter ("W").
<P>This is a temporary patch to stop the menu items for "WikiPathways Web Service Client" from showing up on node and edge popup menus. This must be changed here, versus in the code for the web service client because setting the menu item to empty still causes the menu item to appear, although blank.</P>
<P>The reason for removing the menu is that the node interactions menu item hasn't worked
   at times and when it has, the nodes returned caused the visual style to change.
   So, we remove the menu items to avoid testing and debugging these issues and wait for fixes and will remove this Cytoscape patch in the future.</P> 
<P>Changes were made in cytoscape.data.webservice.ui.WebServiceContextMenu.java.</P>

<LI>Adding the static method CyMain.isLobomizedPluginManagerMode().</LI>
<LI>Changing the code in CytoscapeInit.init(), and PluginManager.registerPlugin() to use CyMain.isLobomizedPluginManagerMode().</LI>

<H2>Cytoscape-AG Release Notes (version 0.01)</H2>

This is a modified version of Cytoscape 2.6.3 for use where Cytoscape is not
the top-level application and a parent application wishes to only use
certain parts of the Cytoscape UI.  For example, making the network
viewer and birds eye viewer accessable independent of the rest of the
Cytoscape UI.  Following is a list of the modifications (see comments
with "MLC 12/08/09"):
<OL>
<LI> "Lobotomized" the plugin manager.to stop remembering previously loaded plugins.
<P>This is necessary to ensure only the plugins given in the command
line of this version of Cytoscape are used for the parent
application. This stops unwanted interactions in between an existing
regular Cytoscape and the use of this version of Cytoscape within the
parent application. The problem is that the pluginManager will
remember what plugins were loaded in passed runs of Cytoscape.
<P>This change is performed in CytoscapeInit.init().</P></LI>
<LI>Added an AGMode that is set by the runstring parameter ("A").
<P>This is done in CyMain.java and includes the additional static
  method CyMain.isAGMode(). When in this mode, Cytoscape's GUI will
  not be presented, and Agilent-specific behavior will be executed. This
  includes:
<OL type=a>
<LI>The Cytoscape master pane is just a blank JPanel().
  <P>This is done through several changes in CytoscapeDesktop.java
  including not setting up and adding to CytoPanels for the vizmapper
  UI and toolbar.</P></LI>
<LI>Removing the use of the VizMapBypassNetworkListener.
<P>We don't want popup menu items on Network nodes and edges for
  changing the visual style properties of these Nodes and Edges. This
  change is located in the CytoscapeDesktop constructor.</P></LI>
<LI>Not calling System.exit() when Cytoscape is exited.
  <P>This is required to stop Cytoscape from exiting its parent application.
    Instead, getDesktop().dispose() is called. This change is in Cytoscape.exit().</P></LI>
</OL>
<P></P><LI>Added runstring parameter ("E").
<P>Sets Cytoscape in EMBEDDED_WINDOW mode to stop Cytoscape from exiting when run by a parent application.</P></LI>
<P></P><LI>Added CytoscapeDesktop.getBirdsEyeView().</LI>
<P></P><LI>Stopped setting the look-and-feel.
<P>This is necessary because the parent application will set the
   look-and-feel. This change is in CyMain.parseCommandLine().</P.</LI>
