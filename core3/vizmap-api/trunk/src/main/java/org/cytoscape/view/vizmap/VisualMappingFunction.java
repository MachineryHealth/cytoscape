/**
 * This class defines how an attribute gets mapped to a visual property.<br />
 * 
 * It takes two values:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Attribute value: node name(Strings), expression values(Numbers), ...</li>
 *  <li>Visual Property: node size(Numbers), edge color(Color), node shape(NodeShape), ...</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * This provides the mapping function from converting the attribute to the visual
 * property.  Essentially, this is a map using <K> as the key and <V> as the value.
 *
 * The direction of mapping is ALWAYS:<br />
 * 
 * K(Attribute) ---> V(Visual Property)
 * 
 * K will be used in implementations.
 * 
 * @param <K> Attribute value object type.  This is the key of this mapping (Can be any objects)
 * @param <V> Visual property value type. (can be any type)
