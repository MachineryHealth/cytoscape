/**
 * The basic interface that any class interested in <b> high
 * frequency events </b> should implement - in general you 
 * should <b>NOT</b> implement this interface unless you are
 * very confident in your usage. If you have any doubt, you
 * should use the normal CyEvent/CyListener combination. At the very
 * least you should try that approach first.
 * <p> 
 * <b> Any class implementing this inteface must implement the
 * method:
 * <p> <code>public void handleMicroEvent(XYZ xyz, ...);</code>
 * <p>where XYZ can be any type of data that needs to be
 * passed from the event source to the listener.</b> 
 * <p>
 * There is no associated CyMicroEvent for CyMicroListener, instead
 * the intent is for the handleMicroEvent method to pass as arguments
 * all data that would have otherwised been passed in an event. 
 * <p>
 * The benefit of this design is that it is fast because we avoid the
 * overhead of creating an event object.  This is useful for high
 * frequency events like adding nodes to a network at load time.
 * <p>
 * However, there are two significant disadvantages to this approach
 * which mean that you should <b>only use this approach if absolutely
 * necessary!!!</b>  The first problem is that this approach is inflexible,
 * since every class that implements the CyMicroListener interface would
 * need to change, if the data communicated by the event were to change,
 * something very time consuming for implementers.  The
 * second problem is that CyMicroListeners are tightly coupled with the
 * event souce object.  
 * <p>
 * The CyEvent/CyListener white-board approach avoids both of these 
 * at the cost of being slightly more resource intensive.  Prefer the
 * CyEvent/CyListener approach for its flexibility, but use the
 * CyMicroListener when speed and efficiency are key concerns.
