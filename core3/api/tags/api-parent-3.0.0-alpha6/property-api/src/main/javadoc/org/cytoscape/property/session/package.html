This package defines a type of specialized
property file for sessions.  Session objects are
generated from XML Schema files.  This allows session objects to be
easily serialized using JAXB to XML files.
<br/>
Please note that the session objects defined in this package
are distinct from {@link org.cytoscape.session.CySession} objects.
These session objects simply reflect the XML property files describing
the state of the user interface for individual sessions, whereas
{@link org.cytoscape.session.CySession} objects actually define
the state of the session in Cytoscape.
