<H1>CytoscapeEditor Release Notes (version 2.53)</H1>
<OL>
<LI>Fixed bug where palette was being redrawn when the Editor tab wasn't
    selected.
<P><LI>Some code cleanup changes to CytoscapeEditorManagerSupport.
</OL>

<H1>Prior Notes</H1>

<H2>CytoscapeEditor Release Notes (version 2.52)</H2>
<OL>

<LI>Changed File->New-Network->EmptyNetwork (NewNetworkAction) to not
produce an extra (accidental) CyNetworkView and to set the visual
style of the new network to be the VisualMappingManager's current
visual style.

<P><LI>Removed arrowhead on default "Directed Edge" edge palette entry in
DefaultCytoscapeEditor.

<P><LI>Fixed so that clicking on the Editor tab would correctly show the correct
editor palette for a given visual style (for sublass editors).

<P>This required stopping the creation of a CyNetworkView in
CytoscapeEditorManagerSupport.onComponentSelected() that would be set
to the default visual style thereby resetting the editor palette for
subclasses (like the HyperEdgeEditor).

<P><LI>Changed call to buildVisualStyle() in
CytoscapeEditorManager.initializeEditor() to occur before
VisualMappingManager.setVisualStyle() is called.

</OL>


<H2>CytoscapeEditor Release Notes (version 2.51)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Simplified CytoscapeEditor initialization with assumption that
the CytoscapeEditor is always loaded before any extension to
this editor.
<P><LI>Removed unneeded definitions of getPluginInfoObject() and describe().
<P><LI>Removed manual setting of EdgeView tooltips, since tooltips should
now be set using Visual Styles.
<P><LI>Fixed NPE bug in CyotscapeEditorManger.register() where
CytoscapeEditorManager.log() statements were being called without null
pointer check.
<P><LI>Updated missed deprecated code reference to use new Cytoscape 2.5
    VizMap API.
</OL>

<H2>CytoscapeEditor Release Notes (version 2.50)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Made CytoscapeEditor be a good citizen for the Cytoscape PluginManager.
<P> Added CytoscapeEditorPlugin.getPluginInfoObject().
<P><LI>Updated code to use new Cytoscape 2.5 VizMap API.
<P><LI>Fixed various deprecations and warnings.
</OL>

<H2>CytoscapeEditor Release Notes (version 2.4 alfa 4)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Added keyboard accelerator for "Delete Selected Nodes and Edges"
menu item.
</OL>

<H2>CytoscapeEditor Release Notes (version 2.4 alfa 3)</H2>
<OL>

<LI>Various changes and cleanup to allow easier subclassing of
CytoscapeEditor and access to the DeleteAction.
<OL type=a>

<P><LI>Some cleanup of DeleteAction an removed 2 parameter
       DeleteAction constructor.
<LI>Cleanup and changed
    BasicCytoscapeEditor.addNodeContextMenuItems(),
    addEdgeContextMenuItems(), and
    removeExistingDeleteMenuItemIfNecessary() to handle changes to
    DeleteAction.
<LI>Added CytoscapeEditorManagerSupport.getDeleteAction() and
    DeleteAction parameter to constructor.
<LI>Changed CytoscapeEditorManager.initialize() to send
CytoscapeEditorManagerSupport the DeleteAction created for use by
subclasses.
</OL>
</OL>

<H2>CytoscapeEditor Release Notes (version 2.4 alfa 2)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Changed the CytoscapeEditor to be intelligent about what drag
cursor is shown when performing a drag-drop from a shape palette entry
to a CyNetworkView of interest.

<P>Built a flexible framework using DragSourceContextCursorSetters
to determine cursor for each palette entry.
</OL>

<H2>CytoscapeEditor Release Notes (version 2.4 alfa 1)</H2>
<OL>

<LI>Refactored BasicNetworkEditEventHandler.finishEdge() into smaller
pieces for subclass usage. Cleaned up
BasicNetworkEditEventHandler.mousePressed() and a few protected
instance variables that should be private.

<P><LI>Cleaned up code and refactored
PaletteNetworkEditEventHandler.itemDropped() and associated methods
for easier use by subclasses and code cleanup.
<P><LI>Removed BioPAXNetworkEditEventHandler.
</OL>

<H2>CytoscapeEditor Release Notes (version 2.3.03)</H2>
<OL>

<LI>Created a new way to easily produce ShapePalette entries for
editors.

<P>This involves the use of new interfaces ShapePaletteInfo and
ShapePaletteInfoGenerator and their supporting classes. Refactored
DefaultCytoscapeEditor to use this new ShapePaletteInfoGenerator.


<P><LI>Added ability of ShapePalette entries to handle visual style
size information.

<P>Changed computation of BasicCytoShapeEntity size to allow for
 larger CytoShapeIcons. Added CytoShapeIcon constructor for handling
 size information. Changed getIconWidth/Height() to return real width
 and height of icon. Changed the ShapePalette JList to no longer use
 setFixedCellHeight() since BasicCytoShapeEntitys can now have
 different sizes.

<P><LI>Added CytoShapeIcon.DEFAULT_WIDTH and DEFAULT_HEIGHT and deprecated
  CytoShapeIcon.WIDTH & HEIGHT.
<P><LI>Removed SimpleBioPAX_Editor.
</OL>


<H2>CytoscapeEditor Release Notes (version 2.3.02)</H2>
<OL>

<H2>CytoscapeEditor Release Notes (version 2.3.01)</H2>

<OL>

<LI>CytoscapeEditorManagerSupport: Fixed updateEditorPalette() to not
assume visualStyleName is the same as Editor name. Added some
comments.

<P><LI>BasicCytoscapeEditor: Removed setting of BIO_PAX attributes from
addNode(). Fixed deprecated method usage in addNode().

<P><LI>BasicCytoShapeEntity, ShapePalette, InvalidEditorException: Added
generated serial version UUID for serializable classes.

CytoscapeEditor: Updated to remove deprecated use of FlagEventListener
(now is SelectEventListener)

<P><LI>CytoscapeEditorManager:
<OL type=a>
  <LI> Fixed so visualStyleName can be different from the editor name.
  <LI> Added getEditorNameForVisualStyleName() and changed
     initializeEditor() to take a visualStyleName parameter.
  <LI> Changed many instance variables to be private vs protected.
  <LI> Added intialization of this manager if register() is called by
       another plugin before this plugin is loaded.
</OL>
<P><LI>CytoscapeEditorPlugin:
<OL type=a>
  <LI> Removed deprecated call to CytoscapeInit.getDefaultVisualStyle() in
     initializeCytoscapeEditor().

  when it is not.
