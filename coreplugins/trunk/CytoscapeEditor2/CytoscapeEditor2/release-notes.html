<H1>CytoscapeEditor Release Notes (version 2.3.01)</H1>

<OL>

<LI>CytoscapeEditorManagerSupport: Fixed updateEditorPalette() to not
assume visualStyleName is the same as Editor name. Added some
comments.

<P><LI>BasicCytoscapeEditor: Removed setting of BIO_PAX attributes from
addNode(). Fixed deprecated method usage in addNode().

<P><LI>BasicCytoShapeEntity, ShapePalette, InvalidEditorException: Added
generated serial version UUID for serializable classes.

CytoscapeEditor: Updated to remove deprecated use of FlagEventListener
(now is SelectEventListener)

<P><LI>CytoscapeEditorManager:
<OL type=a>
  <LI> Fixed so visualStyleName can be different from the editor name.
  <LI> Added getEditorNameForVisualStyleName() and changed
     initializeEditor() to take a visualStyleName parameter.
  <LI> Changed many instance variables to be private vs protected.
  <LI> Added intialization of this manager if register() is called by
       another plugin before this plugin is loaded.
</OL>
<P><LI>CytoscapeEditorPlugin:
<OL type=a>
  <LI> Removed deprecated call to CytoscapeInit.getDefaultVisualStyle() in
     initializeCytoscapeEditor().
  <LI> Removed some misleading code--println that editor is loaded and
  initialization code as though editor is initialized via a menu item,
  when it is not.
