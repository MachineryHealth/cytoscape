<OL type=a>

<P><LI>Some cleanup of DeleteAction an removed 2 parameter
       DeleteAction constructor.
<LI>Cleanup and changed
    BasicCytoscapeEditor.addNodeContextMenuItems(),
    addEdgeContextMenuItems(), and
    removeExistingDeleteMenuItemIfNecessary() to handle changes to
    DeleteAction.
<LI>Added CytoscapeEditorManagerSupport.getDeleteAction() and
    DeleteAction parameter to constructor.

CytoscapeEditorManagerSupport the DeleteAction created for use by

<H2>CytoscapeEditor Release Notes (version 2.4 alfa 2)</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Changed the CytoscapeEditor to be intelligent about what drag
cursor is shown when performing a drag-drop from a shape palette entry
to a CyNetworkView of interest.

<P>Built a flexible framework using DragSourceContextCursorSetters
to determine cursor for each palette entry.
</OL>

<H2>CytoscapeEditor Release Notes (version 2.4 alfa 1)</H2>
<OL>

<LI>Refactored BasicNetworkEditEventHandler.finishEdge() into smaller
pieces for subclass usage. Cleaned up
BasicNetworkEditEventHandler.mousePressed() and a few protected
instance variables that should be private.

<P><LI>Cleaned up code and refactored
PaletteNetworkEditEventHandler.itemDropped() and associated methods
for easier use by subclasses and code cleanup.
<P><LI>Removed BioPAXNetworkEditEventHandler.
</OL>

<H2>CytoscapeEditor Release Notes (version 2.3.03)</H2>
<OL>

<LI>Created a new way to easily produce ShapePalette entries for
editors.

<P>This involves the use of new interfaces ShapePaletteInfo and
ShapePaletteInfoGenerator and their supporting classes. Refactored
DefaultCytoscapeEditor to use this new ShapePaletteInfoGenerator.


<P><LI>Added ability of ShapePalette entries to handle visual style
size information.

<P>Changed computation of BasicCytoShapeEntity size to allow for
 larger CytoShapeIcons. Added CytoShapeIcon constructor for handling
 size information. Changed getIconWidth/Height() to return real width
 and height of icon. Changed the ShapePalette JList to no longer use
 setFixedCellHeight() since BasicCytoShapeEntitys can now have
 different sizes.

<P><LI>Added CytoShapeIcon.DEFAULT_WIDTH and DEFAULT_HEIGHT and deprecated
  CytoShapeIcon.WIDTH & HEIGHT.
<P><LI>Removed SimpleBioPAX_Editor.
</OL>


<H2>CytoscapeEditor Release Notes (version 2.3.02)</H2>
<OL>

to CytoscapeEditorManager.java.
</OL>

<H2>CytoscapeEditor Release Notes (version 2.3.01)</H2>

<OL>

<LI>CytoscapeEditorManagerSupport: Fixed updateEditorPalette() to not
assume visualStyleName is the same as Editor name. Added some
comments.

<P><LI>BasicCytoscapeEditor: Removed setting of BIO_PAX attributes from
addNode(). Fixed deprecated method usage in addNode().

<P><LI>BasicCytoShapeEntity, ShapePalette, InvalidEditorException: Added
generated serial version UUID for serializable classes.

CytoscapeEditor: Updated to remove deprecated use of FlagEventListener
(now is SelectEventListener)

<P><LI>CytoscapeEditorManager:
<OL type=a>
  <LI> Fixed so visualStyleName can be different from the editor name.
  <LI> Added getEditorNameForVisualStyleName() and changed
     initializeEditor() to take a visualStyleName parameter.
  <LI> Changed many instance variables to be private vs protected.
  <LI> Added intialization of this manager if register() is called by
       another plugin before this plugin is loaded.
</OL>
<P><LI>CytoscapeEditorPlugin:
<OL type=a>
  <LI> Removed deprecated call to CytoscapeInit.getDefaultVisualStyle() in
     initializeCytoscapeEditor().
  <LI> Removed some misleading code--println that editor is loaded and
  initialization code as though editor is initialized via a menu item,
  when it is not.
</OL>
