Differences to Excel
====================

1) Most of the functions built into Excel are missing.
2) Cell references look $A1 in Excel, in Cytoscape attribute references look like ${A1}.
3) Excel allows for comparsions like "1<2<3" (Which, bizarrely, evaluates to FALSE!), in Cytoscape only comparisons with one operator are legal.
